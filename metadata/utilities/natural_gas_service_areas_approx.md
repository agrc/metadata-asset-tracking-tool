Utah Natural Gas Service Areas Approx

## ID

0c3c1cd2-ee19-406f-9944-c02587eaee83

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of approximate potential natural gas service areas.

## Summary

This dataset contains approximate boundaries for natural gas service areas and includes information such as the provider name, phone number, and website.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons representing the approximate geographic extent where natural gas services could be provided to private citizens or businesses. This dataset does not include information on pricing or current availability of natural gas services.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartography purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate area where natural gas services could be provided. The features in this dataset also include the name, phone number, and website of the natural gas provider that services that area.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using existing natural gas service lines data. We placed a buffer around the service lines to create the approximate zone that those lines could provide natural gas to. This dataset is updated as new natural gas service lines become available.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is intended for general reference only and is not a comprehensive representation of all natural gas service areas in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
