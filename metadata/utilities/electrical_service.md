## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of electrical service areas in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing the geographical areas serviced by various electricity providers. This dataset is for reference and cartographic purposes only and does not contain information on pricing or current service availability.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons depicting what company or public entity provides electricity to a given area.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographical area covered by a particular electricity provider. Features contain attributes such as the provider name, address, phone number, website, and a cartography number for symbolization (color4).

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using information from the [Utah Division of Public Utilities](https://dpu.utah.gov/) and [Rocky Mountain Power](https://www.rockymountainpower.net/). We derived the polygons using a combination of data layers available in the SGID such as [county parcels](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcels/), [municipality boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/municipal/), and [PLSS sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-sections/). We originally created this layer in 2014 and update it as needed.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of electrical service areas available in Utah, however not all electricity providers are represented in this dataset. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
