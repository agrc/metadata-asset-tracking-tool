## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of electrical service lines in Utah for general reference and cartography.

## Summary

This dataset represents electrical transmission lines in Utah as digital polylines. Further utilities data can be found in the [Utilities Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/utilities/) on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset displays electrical transmission lines in Utah as digital polylines. This dataset contains lines only. Further details about voltage or line type can be found in the [Utah Transmission Lines](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah::utah-transmission-lines/about) dataset available in the SGID.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polyline in this dataset represents the approximate path of an electrical transmission line in Utah.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC digitized these data as part of State of Utah Comprehensive Emergency Earthquake Preparedness Program that was in use from 1986 to 1989.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?
