## Brief Summary

Points dataset of the corners of the Public Land Survey System sections.

## Summary

Point dataset that depicts the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) for the State of Utah and is based on the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB). This dataset was created to provide continuous cadastre data for the state of Utah and is the CadNSDI Version 2.0 2015 of the Utah GCDB.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Originally established in 1785 and currently administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the PLSS is a nationwide framework for surveying, dividing, and quantifying land. This dataset represents the corner points of the PLSS and contains summary information about the coordinate location and steward who collected the data.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The PLSS serves as the backbone for all descriptions of private property and public land boundaries across Utah. Given their foundational role in legal property descriptions, it is imperative that these corner locations remain correct, precise, and readily available. By maintaining the accuracy of these corners and making their locations easily accessible, the potential for boundary discrepancies and disputes is significantly reduced, fostering greater clarity and confidence in land ownership and boundary delineation.

To facilitate this crucial task, UGRC has developed and maintained the [PLSS web application](https://plss.utah.gov/) since 2013, serving as a vital resource for surveyors across the state. Initially designed to provide access to PLSS monument record sheets, the app has since evolved to enable surveyors to upload their own monument record sheets. Continual improvements are made to meet the evolving needs of surveyors, ensuring that the app remains a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for accessing critical survey data. You can read more about the application in our [application portfolio highlights](https://gis.utah.gov/solutions/for-government/application-portfolio-highlights/#plss-monument-records).

### What does the dataset represent?

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using cadastral survey records housed by the BLM, local records, and geographic control coordinates from states, counties, and federal agencies. This data is derived from the [Utah PLSS Fabric](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcel-fabric/). Other PLSS datasets can be found in the [Cadastre Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The geographic coordinates used in this dataset and their associated products are not legal land survey records and can not be used as a substitute for a legal land survey. They should only be used for record keeping, mapping, graphics, and planning purposes. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Land Management for use of the data for purposes not intended by BLM.
