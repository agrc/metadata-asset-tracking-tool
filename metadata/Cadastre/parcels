## Update

### Update Schedule

We aim to update the basic parcels for Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, Washington, and Weber, also known as the Big 5, every month. The rest of the rural counties are on a rotating schedule ranging from quarterly to annually.

LIR parcels are updated annually with county year end tax roll information when provided.
