## Brief Summary

Points dataset of base stations for the Utah Reference Network GPS system.

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations of base stations for The Utah Reference Network. This dataset contains station points only and does not provide a direct connection to the network itself.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The [Utah Reference Network](https://gis.utah.gov/products/turn/), also known as TURN GPS, is comprised of over 100 GPS base stations that provide high-precision, real-time location data and corrections. This network is available in Utah and some surrounding areas. This dataset contains point locations for each of the network's base stations.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset serves as a general reference for both TURN GPS users and the general public. For more information on TURN GPS or to learn more on how to use the network, please visit [our website](https://turngps-billpay.ugrc.utah.gov/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the approximate location of a GPS base station. Features in this dataset include the station name, status, and coordinates.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using coordinates of Turn GPS base stations. We update this dataset as new stations become active.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents all current TurnGPS stations. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
