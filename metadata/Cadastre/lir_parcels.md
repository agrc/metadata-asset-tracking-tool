LIR Parcels

## ID

## Brief Summary

Land Information Records (LIR) Parcel boundaries for all 29 counties in Utah that include a wide variety of attributes beyond the basic information found in Utah Basic Parcels.

## Summary

This dataset contains information such as the county FIPS code, parcel ID, parcel address, generalized land ownership type, currency dates, total market value, tax district, phone number for the county recorder, and the county parcel website if available. Landowners of privately owned parcels are not specified.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

A parcel is a defined area of land that is owned by a public or private entity. LIR Parcels contains advanced attributes such as the total market value and tax district of a given parcel. For parcels data containing basic attributes only, please see our Utah Basic Parcels dataset. Each county provides its individual parcel data to UGRC; thus, users should expect some variation in schema and completeness between counties.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

These data represent UGRC's ongoing efforts to compile statewide parcels following the passage of [HB113](https://le.utah.gov/~2005/bills/hbillenr/HB0113.htm) in 2005. Parcel data are used in city planning, economic development, transportation, public services, and many other areas.

### What does the dataset represent?

In addition to the polygon geometry, LIR Parcels contain a wide variety of advanced attributes such as the total market value of the parcel, square footage of the main structure, and county assessor contact information. Since each county has its own database and process for maintaining tax year assessment information, users should expect some variability in each county's LIR dataset.

### How was the dataset created?

The Land Information Records (LIR) work group organized by the Governor's Office of Management and Budget has facilitated a voluntary sharing of tax roll parcel data from County Assessors to support public safety, economic development, transportation, planning and the provisions of public services. In May of 2016, the Land Information Records work group released its [Land Use Information Records Recommendations](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3ks5ndjMKiZqS5b7N6a3_1paJK0jHi_/edit).

LIR parcels are updated annually with county year end tax roll information when provided.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is not a substitute for obtaining the most current, legal land records information from county authorities. Parcel boundary data found on our website does not represent exact legal boundaries of parcels in Utah and should be used for general analysis and visualization purposes only.

Additionally, while street addresses are provided with the parcel boundaries, the authoritative source for Utah addresses is the [Utah Address Points](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/address-points/) dataset.
