### Previous Updates

In addition to the polygon geometry the attributes COUNTY_NAME, COUNTY_ID, ASSESSOR_SRC, BOUNDARY_SRC, DISCLAIMER, CURRENT_ASOF, PARCEL_ID, SERIAL_NUM, PARCEL_ADD, PARCEL_CITY, TAXEXEMPT_TYPE, TAX_DISTRICT, TOTAL_MKT_VALUE, LAND_MKT_VALUE, PARCEL_ACRES, PROP_CLASS, PRIMARY_RES, HOUSE_CNT, SUBDIV_NAME, BLDG_SQFT, BLDG_SQFT_INFO, FLOORS_CNT, FLOORS_INFO, BUILT_YR, EFFBUILT_YR, CONST_MATERIAL are maintained in the Land Information Record Parcels dataset when available. Since each county has its own database and process for maintaining tax year assessment information, users should expect some variability in each County's LIR dataset.

The Land Information Records (LIR) work group organized by the Governor's Office of Management and Budget has facilitated a voluntary sharing of tax roll parcel data from County Assessors to support public safety, economic development, transportation, planning and the provisions of public services. In May of 2016, the Land Information Records work group released its Land Use Information Records Recommendations

Updates
We aim to update the basic parcels for Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, Washington, and Weber, also known as the Big 5, every month. The rest of the rural counties are on a rotating schedule ranging from quarterly to annually.

LIR parcels are updated annually with county year end tax roll information when provided.
