## Description

### What is the dataset?

Originally established in 1785 and currently administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) is a nationwide framework for surveying, dividing, and quantifying land. PLSS sections are divided into a grid with 640 acres in each square, which is further divided into [quarter sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-quarter-sections/) (160 acres per square) and [quarter quarter sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-quarter-quarter-sections/) (40 acres per square).

This dataset contains PLSS sections with additional attributes to show when the PLSS fabric was last edited.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to show recent and historic edits to the PLSS fabric.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents a PLSS section. Features in this dataset contain the BLM PLSS ID number, section number, township and range (label), number of edits over the lifetime of the section (edits) and the date the section was last edited (edit_date).

### How was the dataset created?

This data is derived from the [Utah PLSS Fabric](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcel-fabric/).

<!--- Is there a particular app or script that updated the edits field when changes are made? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects current section boundaries and displays the number of edits made by all PLSS partners in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
