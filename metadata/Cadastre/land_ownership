## Brief Summary

Land ownership polygons categorized as federal, state, private, or tribal land.

## Summary

Maintained by a joint effort between the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration [(SITLA)](https://trustlands.utah.gov/), the Bureau of Land Management [(BLM)](https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/utah), and UGRC, this dataset represents current land ownership in the state of Utah, categorized as federal, state, private, or tribal land. In the cases of federal, state, or tribal land, this dataset specifies the organization or agency that claims stewardship over that area. However, in the case of private land, this dataset does not identify the specific landowner.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for surface lands in the State of Utah. Land ownership is represented as polygons at a scale of 1:24,000.

We recommend using standard colors when displaying this feature class. A layer file containing the standard color symbology is available for [download](https://sitla.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=30a09ecd4d304a1880f6f0b2fe47c59c) directly from SITLA.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Land ownership data are used by many government and private entities to demarcate boundaries, provide evidence in legal disputes, and display administrative jurisdictions for agencies such as the BLM and the US Forest Service. This dataset is also a helpful resource for public recreation, news outlets, and data analysts.

### What does the dataset represent?

Areas of differing land ownership are delineated as polygons. Features in this dataset include attributes such as official land use designation, the administrator of the parcel, and the area of the parcel in square meters.
