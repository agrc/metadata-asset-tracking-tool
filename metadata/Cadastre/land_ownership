Utah Land Ownership

## ID

e9eba9ba-3950-4b99-89d2-b1d9282133b6

## Brief Summary

Land ownership area polygons categorized as federal, state, private, or tribal land.

## Summary

Maintained by a joint effort between the School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration [(SITLA)](https://trustlands.utah.gov/), the Bureau of Land Management [(BLM)](https://gbp-blm-egis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/utah), and UGRC, this dataset represents current land ownership in the state of Utah. At the top level, it categorizes land as federal, state, private, or tribal land. For federal, state, or tribal land, it further specifies the organization or agency that claims stewardship over that area. However, in the case of private land, it does not identify the specific landowner.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for surface lands in the State of Utah. Land ownership is represented as polygons and is maintained at a scale of 1:24,000.

We recommend using standard colors when displaying this feature class. A layer file containing the standard color symbology is available for [download](https://sitla.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=30a09ecd4d304a1880f6f0b2fe47c59c) directly from SITLA.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Land ownership data are used by many government and private entities to demarcate boundaries, provide evidence in legal disputes, and display administrative jurisdictions for agencies such as the BLM and the US Forest Service. This dataset is also a helpful resource for public recreation, news outlets, and data analysts.

### What does the dataset represent?

Areas of differing land ownership are delineated as polygons. Features in this dataset include attributes such as official land use designation, the administrator of the parcel, and the area of the parcel in square meters. For a full explanation of the field names and descriptions, please see the [schema summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CW9Y8MgxBEo53Hzs7ZdKeAfFeG_6cGwN4WOzAIBDreU/edit?usp=sharing) document.

### How was the dataset created?

Land ownership information is derived from a variety of sources, including BLM [Master Title Plats](https://www.blm.gov/services/land-records), SITLA’s [land and lease records](https://trustlands.utah.gov/resources/policies-records/land-lease/), [Digital Line Graphs](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/eros/science/usgs-eros-archive-digital-line-graphs-dlgs-large-scale), [Digital Raster Graphics](https://www.usgs.gov/publications/digital-raster-graphics-0) and other county and state records.

Maintenance of this data layer is performed by a cooperative federal and state effort between the BLM and SITLA. Both SITLA and the BLM update this dataset weekly.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Land parcels, lease boundaries, and associated SITLA data layers may have been adjusted to allow for visual “best fit.” The Surface Ownership Land Status data (if present) are maintained by the SITLA to reflect current trust lands status and surface ownership. Lakes, rivers, streams, highways, roads, county and state boundaries are distributed UGRC and other sources as specified.

While the Trust Lands Administration seeks to verify data for accuracy and content, discrepancies may exist within the data. Acquiring the most updated Trust Lands Administration ownership GIS data may require contacting the GIS staff at [TLA-GIS@utah.gov].
