## Summary

Maintained by a joint effort between SITLA, the BLM, and UGRC, this dataset represents current land ownership in the state of Utah, categorized as federal, state, private, or tribal land. In the cases of federal, state, or private land, this dataset specifies the organization or agency that claims stewardship over that area. However, in the case of private land, this dataset does not identify the specific landowner.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for surface lands in the State of Utah. Land ownership is represented as polygons at a scale of 1:24,000.

Standard colors are recommended when displaying this feature class. A layer file containing the standard color symbology is available for [download](https://sitla.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=30a09ecd4d304a1880f6f0b2fe47c59c) directly from SITLA.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Land ownership data is used by many government and private entities to demarcate boundaries, provide evidence in legal disputes, and display administrative jurisdictions for agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management and the US Forest Service. This dataset is also a helpful resource for public recreation, news outlets, and data analysts. For example, land ownership data has been used by the [Utah Broadband Center](https://business.utah.gov/broadband/) and UGRC to determine areas with limited broadband internet access in an effort to improve services in  underserved communities. You can learn more about the Utah Broadband Project on our [blog](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2016-02-01-utah-broadband-outreach-center-releases-revamped-availability-map/).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset includes information such as official land use designation, the administrator of the parcel, and the area of the parcel in square meters.
