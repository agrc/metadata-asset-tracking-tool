Turn GPS Baselines

## ID

2e9a22fc-5c30-4447-ad34-ab171cea21f8

## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of the distance between each base station in the TURN GPS network.

## Summary

This dataset contains polylines displaying the geographical distance between TURN GPS base stations. The baselines represent calculated distances only and are not a physical feature.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The [Utah Reference Network](https://gis.utah.gov/products/turn/), also known as TURN GPS, is comprised of over 100 GPS base stations that provide high-precision, real-time location data and corrections. This dataset contains polylines displaying the geographical distance between all available TURN GPS base stations. These baselines model the current coverage of the network and include areas in and around Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This data was created to display and measure the distance between base stations on the TURN GPS network. For more information on TURN GPS or to learn more on how to use the network, please visit [our website](https://turngps-billpay.ugrc.utah.gov/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature in this dataset contains the distance between two given base stations in miles and kilometers, as well as the status of that part of the network. The status codes included in this dataset are for internal use only.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by calculating the geodesic distance between each TURN GPS base station and creating polylines to match those distances. This dataset is maintained by UGRC and is updated as needed.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset measures distance between all current TURN GPS stations. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
