## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

This data was created to display and measure the distance between base stations on the TURN GPS network. Baselines are distance only no physical feature.

This data represents the measured distance between the The Utah Reference Network Global Positioning System (TURN GPS) base stations. It models the current coverage of the network and in some areas extends past the boundary of Utah. Baselines with a distance greater than 70 km will start to decrease your precision.
