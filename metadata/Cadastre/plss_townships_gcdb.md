## Summary

Townships are the first level of a hierarchical break down of the Public Land Survey System Rectangular surveys. This data set represents the GIS Version of the Public Land Survey System version 2.3 2020 of the Utah GCDB. Updates are expected annually as horizontal control positions from published sources and global positioning system (GPS) observations are added. The primary source for the data is cadastral survey records housed by the BLM supplemented with local records and geographic control coordinates from states, counties as well as other federal agencies such as the USGS and USFS. This data was originally published on 1/3/2017

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Originally established in 1785 and currently administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the PLSS is a nationwide framework for surveying, dividing, and quantifying land. PLSS sections are divided into a grid with 640 acres in each square, which is further divided into quarter sections (160 acres per square) and quarter quarter sections (40 acres per square). This dataset represents this final division as polygons.

The polygons in this feature class represent the smallest division that has been defined by the BLM. This data is derived from the [Utah PLSS Fabric](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcel-fabric/). Other PLSS datasets can be found in the [Cadastre Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/).
