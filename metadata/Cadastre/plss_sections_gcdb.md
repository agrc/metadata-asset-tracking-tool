Utah PLSS Sections GCDB

## ID

d9ac0241-402b-464e-90bd-d2f8eb56685d

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of the primary unit of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS), where each unit represents one square mile of land (640 acres).

## Summary

This dataset represents the largest unit of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS). Each polygon represents 640 acres of land and is labelled  its township, range, and section identifiers. We used Geographic Coordinate Database ([GCDB](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/4f4e4a7fe4b07f02db648dce)) base attributes to create this feature class.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset is the primary or first subdivision of the PLSS. Originally established in 1785 and currently administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the PLSS is a nationwide framework for surveying, dividing, and quantifying land. PLSS sections are divided into a grid with 640 acres in each square, which is further divided into [quarter sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-quarter-sections/) (160 acres per square) and [quarter quarter sections](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/plss-quarter-quarter-sections/) (40 acres per square).

This data is derived from the [Utah PLSS Fabric](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcel-fabric/). Other PLSS datasets can be found in the [Cadastre Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

PLSS data are used in many areas of natural resource management, land ownership designation, and public planning. Though not a substitute for a legal land survey, this dataset is a helpful resource for cartography and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land Description (LLD) dataset, which can be found in the the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records system.

### How was the dataset created?

The primary source for the data are cadastral survey records housed by the BLM and supplemented with local records and geographic control coordinates from states, counties, and federal agencies. This data was originally published in January of 2017 and is based on GCDB coordinate data.

This statewide dataset is maintained by UGRC in partnership with the BLM and local government authorities.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of PLSS sections in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions about this dataset.
