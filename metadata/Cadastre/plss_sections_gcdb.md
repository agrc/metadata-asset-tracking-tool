## Description

PLSS Sections GCDB is a polygon dataset. This entity is the primary or first subdivisions of a Public Land Survey System Township commonly 1 mile square approximately 640 acres.This layer is based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) coordinate data. The locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in geographic coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and BLM survey plats/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey firms, and local governments.

### What is the dataset?

Originally established in 1785 and currently administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the PLSS is a nationwide framework for surveying, dividing, and quantifying land. PLSS sections are divided into a grid with 640 acres in each square, which is further divided into quarter sections (160 acres per square) and quarter quarter sections (40 acres per square).

This data is derived from the [Utah PLSS Fabric](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/parcel-fabric/). Other PLSS datasets can be found in the [Cadastre Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

PLSS data are used in many areas of natural resource management, land ownership designation, and public planning. Though not a substitute for a legal land survey, this dataset is a helpful resource for cartography and general analytic purposes.
