# Title

Utah Major Rivers Polygons

## ID

1c55b611-a00e-4c19-b0a9-8534ed722ce7

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Utah rivers wider than 10 feet.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing major rivers in Utah. UGRC derived this dataset from the National Hydrography Dataset from the United States Geological Survey. This dataset contains large watercourses only; other water body data such as [lakes](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/nhd-lakes/) and [streams](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/nhd-streams/) can be found in the [Water Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analyzing water-related information. UGRC has modified the source data to provide a more focused subset for Utah-based users. This dataset includes major rivers in Utah as well as some lakes and ponds.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analyzing water-related information. River data are also a helpful resource for [cartography](https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/sites/static/files/2014-09/documents/utah.pdf), public recreation, and data analysis. NHD-based datasets can be combined with other data layers such as soils, land use, and population to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon feature in this dataset represents the length and area of a major river in Utah.

### How was the dataset created?

The United States Geological Survey ([USGS](usgs.gov)) maintains the current high-resolution NHD at a 1:24,000 scale. The NHD was originally created in the late 1990s by USGS in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/)) at a 1:100,000 scale. Both the high-resolution and moderate scale datasets are available nationwide.

More information on the history of this database can be found in [official publications](https://www.horizon-systems.com/NHDPlusData/NHDPlusV21/Documentation/History/Making_the_Digital_Water_Flow.pdf) from USGS and on the [NHD website](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201990s%2C%20the,and%20those%20of%20other%20medium).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The NHD is the primary source for hydrographic data in the United States. It represents a nationally consistent, interoperable dataset that facilitates accurate data sharing. Questions or concerns about this dataset can be directed to [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution). Utah-specific inquiries can be directed to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) at UGRC.
