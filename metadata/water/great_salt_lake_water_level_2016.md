## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of the Great Salt Lake water level in 2016, as derived from Lidar data.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing the approximate water line of the Great Salt Lake in 2016. The data were derived from a 2016 Lidar project.

## Description

This dataset represents the Great Salt Lake water level and shoreline from the 2016 Lidar collection project. You can learn more about the lake and surrounding area on the official [Great Salt Lake website](https://greatsaltlake.utah.gov/).

### What is the dataset?

The Great Salt Lake is the largest saltwater lake in the western hemisphere, [spanning approximately 1700 square miles](https://geology.utah.gov/popular/great-salt-lake/commonly-asked-questions/#:~:text=At%204%2C200%20feet%20Great%20Salt,lowest%20level%20September%20to%20December.) on an average year. The water level and area of the Great Salt Lake are affected by a wide variety of environmental factors, which are closely monitored by state and regional officials. This dataset contains polygons representing the extent of the lake in 2016.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

There are two polygons in this dataset, one for the south arm of the lake and one for the north. Each feature contains the elevation of the water in meters and feet as well as the source for the data.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this dataset from the breakline features associated with the [2016 Great Salt Lake Lidar project](https://geology.utah.gov/docs/lidar/pdf/GSL2_Report.pdf). We extracted lake features from the original breakline shapefile and converted them into polygons, then removed all polygons outside of the main north and south arms of the lake.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

These data do not reflect current conditions of the lake; this layer is to be used as a historical reference only. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
