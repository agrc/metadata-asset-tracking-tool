## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

This dataset represents the Great Salt Lake water level and shoreline from the 2016 LiDAR collection project.

Last updated: May 3, 2022

This dataset was derived from the breakline features associated with the 2016 Great Salt Lake LiDAR project. To create this dataset the Lake Pond features were extracted from the GreatSaltLake_Breaklines shapefile and converted into polygons. All polygons outside of the main north and south arms of the lake were removed. The Elevation_m (elev_m) & Elevation_ft (elev_ft) values represent the elevation of the water when the LiDAR was acquired.
