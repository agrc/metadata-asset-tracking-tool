## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of the Great Salt Lake at varying water levels.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing the Great Salt Lake at various different water levels. You can learn more about the lake and surrounding area on the official [Great Salt Lake website](https://greatsaltlake.utah.gov/).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Great Salt Lake is the largest saltwater lake in the western hemisphere, [spanning approximately 1700 square miles](https://geology.utah.gov/popular/great-salt-lake/commonly-asked-questions/#:~:text=At%204%2C200%20feet%20Great%20Salt,lowest%20level%20September%20to%20December.) on an average year. The water level and area of the Great Salt Lake are affected by a wide variety of environmental factors, which are closely monitored by state and regional officials. This dataset contains polygons representing the extent of the lake at various times and seasons throughout the lake's history.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature contains the elevation of the water in meters and feet as well as the source for the data.

<!--- Do the polygons in this dataset represent the extent of the lake at a particular time, or was the data collected all at once and the polygons just represent differing elevation levels? --->

### How was the dataset created?

<!--- Was this dataset derived from Lidar, or another source? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This layer represents the approximate geographic extent of the Great Salt Lake only. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.

<!--- Does this layer show the current extent of the lake, or is it a layer for historical reference? --->
