# Title

Utah Stream Gauges NHD

## ID

a3e384d1-eaaa-4887-a9f7-f49ab60ea6f4

## Brief Summary

Points dataset of USGS gauges used to measure watercourse output.

## Summary

This dataset is derived from the [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset) (NHD) and has been modified by UGRC to show stream gauges found in Utah only.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) [defines a stream gauge](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/utah-water-science-center/science/what-streamgage) as a device that "contains instruments that measure and record the amount of water flowing in a river or stream, or its discharge." This dataset contains points representing the locations of permanent stream gauges in Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analyzing water-related information. Stream gauge data are used in local and regional planning, hydrologic studies, and environmental assessments. NHD-based datasets can be combined with other data layers such as soils, land use, and population to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Further water-related data can be found on the SGID [Water Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the approximate location of a stream gauge. Features in this dataset contain the [reach code](https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.tri_page?p_column_name=reach_code#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20reach%20code%20is,National%20Hydrography%20Dataset%20(NHD).) for networked features, gauge name, and other attributes.

### How was the dataset created?

The United States Geological Survey ([USGS](usgs.gov)) maintains the current high-resolution NHD at a 1:24,000 scale. The NHD was originally created in the late 1990s by USGS in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/)) at a 1:100,000 scale. Both the high-resolution and moderate scale datasets are available nationwide.

More information on the history of this database can be found in [official publications](https://www.horizon-systems.com/NHDPlusData/NHDPlusV21/Documentation/History/Making_the_Digital_Water_Flow.pdf) from USGS and on the [NHD website](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201990s%2C%20the,and%20those%20of%20other%20medium).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The NHD is the primary source for hydrographic data in the United States. It represents a nationally consistent, interoperable dataset that facilitates accurate data sharing. Questions or concerns about this dataset can be directed to [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution).
