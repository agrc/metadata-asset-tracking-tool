# Title

Utah Watershed Areas

## ID

619433b6-cdf7-4267-8a2a-3a4436a3eeac

## Brief Summary

Utah watershed areas represented by Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) 8, 10, and 12.

## Summary

This dataset represents watershed areas as polygons. It is derived from the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset and includes polygons with the Hydrologic Unit Codes 8, 10, and 12 (sub-basins, watersheds, and sub-watersheds respectively).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The United States Geologic Survey defines a watershed as a "the area of the landscape that drains to a portion of the stream network". Watershed areas in this dataset are represented as polygons and include several sub-categories such as sub-basins (HUC 8), watersheds (HUC 10) and sub-watersheds (HUC 12).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is a tool for water resource management and planning activities. It is suitable for general analytic purposes and cartography.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic extent of a particular watershed area. The data can be dissolved by [HUC level](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/hucs.aspx) to obtain HUC10 and HUC8 boundaries as the boundaries are coincident. The data contains the attributes from all 3 HUC levels.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this layer using data from the USGS [Watershed Boundary Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset) (WBD). We downloaded data in GDB format and merged HUC8, HUC10, and HUC12, maintaining the line work for HUC12. This final product contains watershed areas in and around Utah.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current version of watershed areas in Utah from USGS. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
