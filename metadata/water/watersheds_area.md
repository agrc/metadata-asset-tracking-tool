## ID

619433b6-cdf7-4267-8a2a-3a4436a3eeac

## Brief Summary

Utah watershed areas represented by Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) 8, 10, and 12.

## Summary

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the State of Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is a tool for water resource management and planning activities. It is suitable for general analytic purposes and cartography.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic extent of a particular watershed. This allows the data to be dissolved by [HUC level](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/hucs.aspx) to obtain HUC10 and HUC8 boundaries as the boundaries are coincident. The data contains the attributes from all 3 HUC levels.

### How was the dataset created?

Utah Watershed Area was built using data from the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). Data was downloaded from the download-by-state area in GDB format. HUC8, HUC10 and HUC12 datasets were merged into this dataset, maintaining the line work for HUC12.
