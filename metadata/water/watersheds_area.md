Utah Watershed Areas

## ID

619433b6-cdf7-4267-8a2a-3a4436a3eeac

## Brief Summary

Utah watershed areas represented by Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUC) 8, 10, and 12.

## Summary

Utah Watershed Area was built using data from the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD). Data was downloaded from the download-by-state area in GDB format. HUC8, HUC10 and HUC12 datasets were merged into this dataset, maintaining the line work for HUC12. This allows the data to be dissolved by HUC level to obtain HUC10 and HUC8 boundaries as the boundaries are coincident. The data contains the attributes from all 3 HUC levels.

HUC_8
Contains the 8 digit hydrologic unit code for the 4th level sub-basins.
HU_8_NAME
Contains the sub-basin name.
HUC_10
Contains the 10 digit hydrologic unit code for the 5th level watersheds.
HU_10_NAME
Contains the watershed name.
HUG_12
Contains the 12 digit hydrologic unit code for the 6th level sub-watersheds.
HU_12_NAME
Contains the sub-watershed name.
This data set is intended to be used as a tool for water-resource management and planning activities, particularly for site-specific and localized studies requiring a level of detail provided by large-scale map information.
