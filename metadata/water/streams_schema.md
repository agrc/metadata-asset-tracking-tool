## ID

b05ae129-2047-464e-bac4-3edf3a16cd9a

### permanent_identifier

<!--- No definition for this field. -->

### fdate

The date the feature was added to the dataset.

### resolution

Resolution of the feature, where the value 2 indicates high resolution.

### gnis_name

Watercourse name found in the [GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis).

### lengthkm

Length of the watercourse in kilometers.

### reachcode

From the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.tri_page?p_column_name=reach_code#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20reach%20code%20is,National%20Hydrography%20Dataset%20(NHD).): “A reach code is a unique 14-digit code that identifies a continuous piece of surface water with similar hydrologic characteristics. It is assigned to each receiving water body by the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).” Reach addresses establish the locations of features relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets.

### flowdir

<!--- No definition for this field. -->

### ftype

A three-digit code that can be used to classify water body features by NHD functional type. The Ftype informs the user as to what type of watercourse the feature is.

### ftype_text

Associated text for the Ftype code.

### fcode

A six-digit code that can be used to classify water body features by NHD functional type. The [Fcode](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains) informs the user what type of water body the feature is, whether the feature is perennial, and its elevation type.

### fcode_text

Associated text for the Fcode.

### enabled

### ismajor

Identifies major rivers and streams for coarse scale mapping and display.

Values:

- 1 = Major
- 0 = Minor.

### inutah

Identifies whether a given body of water is within the state boundary. Features have been split at the state boundary.

Values:

- 1 = In Utah
- 0 = Outside of Utah

### submerged

Can be used to exclude the hydrologic network features that have been added across water bodies to the NHD dataset for linear water flow modeling.

Values:

- 1 = Submerged
- 0 = Surface.
