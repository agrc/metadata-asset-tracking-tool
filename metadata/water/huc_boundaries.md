Utah HUC Boundaries

## ID

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of watershed subbasin boundaries in Utah as derived from the USGS Watershed Boundary Dataset.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing hydrologic subbasins in Utah as defined by the nationwide Watershed Boundary Dataset from USGS. Features in this dataset contain the name and HUC code of subbasins found in and around Utah. Further [watershed data](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/watersheds/), including subwatersheds, can be found in the [Water Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Watershed areas in the United States are delineated using a national system developed by the [United States Geological Survey](https://www.usgs.gov/) (USGS). This system divides the nation into regions, subregions, basins, subbasins, watersheds, and subwatersheds. This dataset is a subset of the nationwide [Watershed Boundary Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/watershed-boundary-dataset) that displays polygons representing subbasin boundaries found in and around Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Subbasin data are used for water resource management and planning by a variety of local, state, and federal agencies. This layer is suitable for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic area of a subbasin as delineated by the Watershed Boundary Dataset. Features include the name and the Hyrologic Unit Code (HUC) of each subbasin. You can learn more about hydrologic units and interpreting HUC codes through the [USGS website](https://water.usgs.gov/themes/hydrologic-units/) and [other documentation](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/watershed-boundary-dataset-wbd-data-dictionary).

### How was the dataset created?

This layer was created using data from the United States Department of Agriculture and the Watershed Boundary Dataset from USGS. The polygons in this dataset have been dissolved to the subbasin level with corresponding eight-digit HUC codes.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The Watershed Boundary Dataset is the primary source for watershed data in the United States. This dataset is only a subset of the national dataset. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
