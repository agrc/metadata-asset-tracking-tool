## Brief Summary

## Summary

This dataset contains a polygon representation of Lake Bonneville, a historic Ice Age lake that was the predecessor for the modern Great Salt Lake. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not contain other hydrologic attributes. You can learn more about Lake Bonneville through [documentation](https://geology.utah.gov/popular/great-salt-lake/) from the Utah Geological Survey.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Lake Bonneville was the largest lake in the Great Basin of North America during the late Pleistocene age. At its largest extent, it covered more than 19,000 square miles throughout the state of Utah. Over a period of several thousand years, the lake system eventually evolved into the [Great Salt Lake](https://greatsaltlake.utah.gov/) through a series of geologic and hydrologic processes. This dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of Lake Bonneville, which refers to the lake system from about 30,000 years ago to 13,000 years ago. From 13,000 years ago to today, the same lake system is referred to as the Great Salt Lake.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference, research, and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset indicates the approximate geographic coverage of Lake Bonneville during the Pleistocene age, or about 30,000 years ago.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC derived this dataset using polyline data from a [2016 study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277379116307399?via%3Dihub) published in the journal [Quaternary Science Reviews](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/quaternary-science-reviews).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the most recently established and peer-reviewed geographic boundary of Lake Bonneville. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
