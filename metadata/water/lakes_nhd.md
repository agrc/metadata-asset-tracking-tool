# Title

Utah Lakes NHD

## ID

b0a55056-bdb9-4b7c-8812-8f246b328f88

## Brief Summary

Statewide bodies of water including lakes, reservoirs, and ponds derived from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).

## Summary

This dataset contains bodies of water found in and around the state of Utah. This dataset is derived from the [National Hydrography Dataset](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset) (NHD) and has been modified by UGRC to provide additional functionality for Utah-based users.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analyzing water-related information. UGRC has modified the source NHD data by adding four fields (FType_Text, FCode_Text, InUtah and IsMajor) and splitting features at the state boundary. In addition to the fields we've added, this dataset contains [reach codes](https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.tri_page?p_column_name=reach_code#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20reach%20code%20is,National%20Hydrography%20Dataset%20(NHD).) for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for water bodies. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Water body data are also a helpful resource for [cartography](https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/sites/static/files/2014-09/documents/utah.pdf), public recreation, and data analysis. NHD-based datasets can be combined with other data layers such as soils, land use, and population to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Further water-related data can be found on the SGID [Water Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset approximates bodies of water as polygons that include attributes such as the area in square kilometers and [GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis) name. Each polygon has also been categorized as major or minor using UGRC's custom fields. The "IsMajor" field identifies major lakes for coarse scale mapping and display, where 1 = major and 0 = minor. The "InUtah" field identifies whether a given body of water is within the state boundary, where 1 = in Utah and 0 = outside of Utah.

### How was the dataset created?

The current high-resolution, 1:24,000 scale NHD is an improvement of the original 1:100,000 scale dataset first created in the late 1990s by the USGS in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency [(EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/). It was created by the USGS and United States Forest Service [(USFS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/) in the 2000s while the EPA maintained the original, moderate-scale dataset.

More information on the history of this database can be found in [publications](https://www.horizon-systems.com/NHDPlusData/NHDPlusV21/Documentation/History/Making_the_Digital_Water_Flow.pdf) from USGS and on the [NHD website](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201990s%2C%20the,and%20those%20of%20other%20medium).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The NHD is the primary source for water body data in the United States. It represents a nationally consistent, interoperable dataset that facilitates accurate data sharing between entities. Questions or concerns about this dataset can be directed to [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/nhdplus-high-resolution). Utah-specific inquiries can be directed to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) at UGRC.
