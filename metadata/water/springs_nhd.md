# Title

Utah Springs NHD

## ID

f3e70f49-8623-4d66-b3b2-32d777db5409

## Brief Summary

Point locations of springs and seeps in Utah derived from the National Hydrography Dataset.

## Summary

This dataset contains points representing springs and seeps in Utah. UGRC derived this dataset from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) from the United States Geological Survey. This dataset contains springs and other groundwater sources only; other water data such as [rivers](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah::utah-major-rivers-polygons/about) and [streams](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/nhd-streams/) can be found in the [Water Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/water/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analyzing water-related information. UGRC has modified the source data to provide a more focused subset for Utah-based users. This dataset includes springs and seeps in Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

UGRC created this dataset to provide a focused subset of springs for Utah-based users. Spring data are also a helpful resource for cartography, public recreation, and data analysis. NHD-based datasets can be combined with other data layers such as soils, land use, and population to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point feature in this dataset represents the approximate location of a spring or seep. Features in this dataset include the fcode, ftype, the area in square kilometers, and other NHD attributes. Further information on interpreting the codes in this dataset can be found on the [USGS website](https://www.usgs.gov/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains).

### How was the dataset created?

The United States Geological Survey ([USGS](usgs.gov)) maintains the current high-resolution NHD at a 1:24,000 scale. The NHD was originally created in the late 1990s by USGS in collaboration with the Environmental Protection Agency ([EPA](https://www.epa.gov/)) at a 1:100,000 scale. Both the high-resolution and moderate scale datasets are available nationwide.

More information on the history of this database can be found in [official publications](https://www.horizon-systems.com/NHDPlusData/NHDPlusV21/Documentation/History/Making_the_Digital_Water_Flow.pdf) from USGS and on the [NHD website](https://www.usgs.gov/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset#:~:text=In%20the%20late%201990s%2C%20the,and%20those%20of%20other%20medium).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?
