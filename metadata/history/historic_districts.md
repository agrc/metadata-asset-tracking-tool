## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygon boundaries of areas listed as historic districts under the [National Register of Historic Places](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/nationalregister/index.htm). The National Register is a program of the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/index.htm) that designated historic places and areas for research and protection. These historic districts may include neighborhoods, downtown areas, and other zones with historical or cultural significance. Properties listed individually on the National Register of Historic Places are not included as part of this dataset.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

These data are used for research and planning, cultural resource compliance under the [National Historic Preservation Act of 1966](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/archeology/national-historic-preservation-act.htm), and other general purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of a historic district in Utah. Features in this dataset include the name, city, county, and ZIP code of the historic district.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC derived these data from physical maps and property descriptions provided by the Utah Historical Society. These data are consistent with the National Register Nominations prepared for each district and filed with the [Utah State Preservation Office](https://ushpo.utah.gov/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete geospatial resource for historic districts in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
