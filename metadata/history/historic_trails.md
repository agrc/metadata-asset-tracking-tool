## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of historic trails used by exploration and settlement parties during the late 18th century.

## Summary

This dataset depicts historic trails used by early exploration and settlement parties who traveled to and from Utah during the late 18th century. Trails in this dataset are managed by both state and federal entities and have been set aside for preservation and archaeological research. This dataset contains polyline geometry only and does not contain visitor information. You can learn more about Utah's historic trails on the [Utah History to Go](https://historytogo.utah.gov/historic-trails/) website.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset depicts polyline segments representing historic trails used by exploration and settlement parties from 1776 to 1880. Several of these trails are registered as National Historic Trails through the National Park Service, such as the California and Pony Express trails. These data reflect historian consensus as of 1998.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is for regional analysis and display at 1:500,000 scale and was used in the creation of the Utah Historic Trails map published by the [Utah Historical Society](https://history.utah.gov/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each trail in this dataset is represented by multiple polyline segments which can be dissolved by the trailname field to create single line trail features. This dataset also includes attributes such as the route name, county, state, and current administrator of the historic trail.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using historical maps and records provided by the Utah Historical Society.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains historic trails only and does not depict all trails and pathways in Utah. Further trails data are included in the [Recreation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/recreation/) available from the SGID.
