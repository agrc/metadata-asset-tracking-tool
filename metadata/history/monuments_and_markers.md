## Brief Summary

## Summary

This dataset contains Monuments and Markers across the state of Utah. Monuments and Markers spatial data maintained by the Utah Division of State History.

This dataset enables historians, researchers, and citizens to access the name, location, text, photos, and other information about markers located throughout Utah. A marker contains the text and may be a bronze, aluminum, or wood plaque. The monument holds the marker and, in most cases, is a freestanding structure made of wood, stone, or brick. In cases where the marker is inscribed directly on the monument, then the marker and the monument are the same.
