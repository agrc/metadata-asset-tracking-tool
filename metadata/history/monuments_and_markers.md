## Brief Summary

Points dataset of historical monuments and memorial markers in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations of historical monuments and memorial markers in Utah. UGRC derived this data from the [Utah Historical Society](https://history.utah.gov/).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations of over 1500 historical monuments and markers in Utah. Markers include metal, wooden, or bronze plaques that may accompany statues, artistic installations, public displays, and other types of commemorative structures. This dataset does not include museums, cemetaries, or halls of fame.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset enables historians, researchers, and citizens to access the name, location, text, photos, and other information about markers located throughout Utah. It is suitable for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the location of a monument or marker. Points are placed as close to the commemorative plaque as possible. In cases where the marker is inscribed directly on the monument, then the marker and the monument are the same feature. Each feature in this layer contains attributes such as the name, type of marker, city and county the marker is located in, and what the marker commemorates.
