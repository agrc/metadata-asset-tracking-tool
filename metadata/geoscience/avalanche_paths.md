## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of avalanche slide paths found in the Tri-Canyon Area of the Wasatch Front.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing avalanche paths in and around Big Cottonwood, Little Cottonwood, and Millcreek canyons as of 1989. Please see the [Utah Avalanche Center](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/) website for current avalanche information and forecasts.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

An avalanche path, also called a slide path, is an area where an avalanche can occur, from the starting point (usually a slope steeper than 30 degrees) to the terminus. This dataset contains slide paths for avalanches in the Tri-Canyon Area, which comprises Millcreek, Big Cottonwood, and Little Cottonwood canyons.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

UGRC prepared this dataset for the Salt Lake County Wasatch Canyons Master Plan originally published in September 1989. You can learn more about current management plans for the area on the Salt Lake County [Canyons Management](https://www.saltlakecounty.gov/regional-development/Canyons-Management/) website.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon displays the approximate slide path of an avalanche zone. Features in this dataset contain the name, size of the slide path, return interval, starting zone elevation, vertical fall, and starting zone aspect for some of the avalanches.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC identified and digitized avalanche paths from aerial photography and 7.5 minute USGS quadrangles.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset was prepared for a 1989 management plan for the Tri-Canyon Area and is not a current representation of avalanche conditions. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
