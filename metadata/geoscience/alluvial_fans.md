## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of alluvial fans for cartography and geologic hazard analysis.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygon representations of alluvial fans in Utah. You can learn more about alluvial fans and emergency preparedness on the [Utah Flood Hazards and Floodplain Management](https://floodhazards.utah.gov/home/alluvial-fans/) website. Further geologic hazard and other natural landform data can be found on the [Geoscience Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/geoscience/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Alluvial fans are landforms created by flowing water that interacts with mountains, hills, or steep canyon walls. Silt, sand, gravel, boulders, and woody debris can be deposited over time by powerful rivers or small creeks, eventually forming a fan-shaped geologic structure. The top, or narrow point, of an alluvial fan is called the apex, and the wider portion is called the apron or cone. Due to their unique shape, alluvial fans pose significant flooding hazards that are not present on other types of watercourses such as rivers or streams. The [Utah Division of Emergency Management](https://dem.utah.gov/) studies and quantifies alluvial fans to bolster emergency planning efforts.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Properly identifying alluvial fan landforms is a critical first step in understanding flood risk to downstream development. You can learn more about how alluvial fan data factors into emergency preparedness on the [interactive map](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/646356d3a2eb4db4bf6397edff54c09d/page/Floods%2C-Fires-%26-Fans/) available from the Department of Public Safety.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of an alluvial fan landform. Features in this dataset may include the names of nearby watercourses or municipalities as well as a geologic map description and hazard level. The relative hazard level of an alluvial fan is defined as either moderate or high by the [Utah Geological Survey](https://geology.utah.gov/) (UGS).

### How was the dataset created?

Alluvial fans in this dataset were digitized from a variety of sources, including existing geologic mapping from the years 1964 to 2013, [USGS Quadrangles](https://www.usgs.gov/node/25175), aerial photography from the years 1937 to 2017, UGS flood and landslide hazard mapping, the [FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer](https://www.fema.gov/flood-maps/national-flood-hazard-layer), and field investigations with photos. This dataset is maintained in collaboration with many state and federal partners.

<!--- What exactly is our involvement with these data? Do we just host the layer, or do we maintain it as well? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The polygons in this dataset represent approximate extents of alluvial fans only. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
