## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of BLM areas considered for the National Conservation Lands System in 1995.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons that were included in a 1995 proposal to designate certain areas in San Juan County as National Conservation Areas. This dataset contains historic proposed boundary information only and does not contain current information on NCAs in Utah.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/) (BLM) defines [National Conservation Lands](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands) as areas that conserve natural features, offer exceptional recreational opportunities or possess historic or scientific value. This dataset contains polygons of areas that were considered for NCA designation in a 1995 proposal in San Juan County, Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and research purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of an area proposed for NCA designation. Features in this dataset include the NCA name and acreage.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset at the direction of San Juan County. We selected areas from the BLM Wilderness Proposal and later updated this layer with [Utah Trust Lands](https://trustlands.utah.gov/) boundaries from 1995.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents boundaries from a 1995 proposal only and is not representative of current NCA boundaries in or out of San Juan County. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
