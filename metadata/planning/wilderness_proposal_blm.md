## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas considered for wilderness designation as part of a 1995 proposal.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons for areas proposed for wilderness designation in 1995. For datasets of current areas designated as wilderness or under consideration, please see the [Utah Wilderness Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/wilderness/) and [BLM Wilderness Study Areas for Utah](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/blm-wilderness-study-areas/) layers.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Established in 1964, the National Wilderness Preservation System allows for the protection and preservation of designated natural areas throughout the United States. This dataset contains polygons representing areas in Utah that were considered for official wilderness designation during a 1995 inventory of Utah's public lands. You can learn more about wilderness areas through [resources from the Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/wilderness) (BLM).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Wilderness area data are used for natural resource management, [NEPA](https://www.epa.gov/nepa) documentation, and recreational planning.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of a proposed wilderness area in Utah. Features in this dataset include the BLM unit, name, acreage, and whether or not the area is a [Utah Trust Land](https://trustlands.utah.gov/) (is_this_state).

### How was the dataset created?

The BLM developed these areas by selecting areas from their earlier dataset of [BLM Wilderness Study Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/blm-wilderness-study-areas/). The resulting BLM Proposed Action was documented in the [Utah BLM Statewide Wilderness Final Environmental Impact Statement](https://archive.org/details/utahblmstatewide3bunit) (1990). UGRC used this data from the BLM and updated the layer with the State of Utah Trust Lands as they existed in 1995.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains proposed wilderness areas previously considered by the Bureau of Land Management. This layer is intended for historic reference and does not reflect current wilderness or wilderness study area boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
