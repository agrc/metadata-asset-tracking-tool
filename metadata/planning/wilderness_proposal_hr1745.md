## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas considered for wilderness designation under the Utah Public Lands Management Act of 1995.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons for areas proposed for wilderness designation by The US Congressional Delegation in 1995. For datasets of current areas designated as wilderness or under consideration, please see the [Utah Wilderness Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/wilderness/) and [BLM Wilderness Study Areas for Utah](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/blm-wilderness-study-areas/) layers. You can learn more about wilderness areas through [resources from the Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/wilderness) (BLM).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Established in 1964, the National Wilderness Preservation System allows for the protection and preservation of designated natural areas throughout the United States. This dataset contains polygons representing areas in Utah that were considered for official wilderness designation as part of HR 1745, also known as the [Utah Public Lands Management Act of 1995](https://www.congress.gov/bill/104th-congress/house-bill/1745/actions). The bill was introduced in 1995 and sponsored by Representative Jim Hansen.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Wilderness area data are used for natural resource management, [NEPA](https://www.epa.gov/nepa) documentation, and recreational planning.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of a proposed wilderness area in Utah. Features in this dataset include the BLM unit, name, and area in acres.

### How was the dataset created?

The BLM developed these areas by selecting areas from their earlier dataset of [BLM Wilderness Study Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/blm-wilderness-study-areas/). The resulting BLM Proposed Action was documented in the [Utah BLM Statewide Wilderness Final Environmental Impact Statement](https://archive.org/details/utahblmstatewide3bunit) (1990). The automated data were received from the BLM and updated by UGRC with the State of Utah Trust Lands delineated, as they existed in 1995.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains proposed wilderness areas only. This layer is intended for historic reference and does not reflect current wilderness or wilderness study area boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
