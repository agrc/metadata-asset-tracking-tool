## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of agricultural and other similarly designated land use areas in and around Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing agricultural areas and other water-related land use zones. These polygons include data derived from [Cropland Data Layer](https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/) (CDL) rasters from the [United States Department of Agriculture](https://www.usda.gov/) (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The USDA defines [six major types of land use](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/major-land-uses) in the United States; pasture/range, forest, cropland, special use, miscellaneous, and urban. This dataset contains areas defined as cropland and other similarly designated agricultural areas found in and around Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

These data are used in agricultural and municipal planning, cartography, and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the crop type and designated land use for a particular area. Other attributes describe the primary irrigation method, acreage, hydrologic basin and subarea of the polygon, and majority pixel value from the USDA [CDL Cropscape](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php) raster layer.

### How was the dataset created?

The [Division of Water Resources](https://water.utah.gov/) developed this dataset from a variety of sources, including data collected by field crews, satellite imagery, and other reference layers. The field crews quantified land use, irrigation methods, and other attributes. The polygon geometry was digitized from [Sentinel satellite imagery](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/). They used [Zonal Statistics](https://atlas.co/glossary/zonal-statistics/) and CDL data to define crop types within the polygons. Finally, the data were compared with historical inventories to verify accuracy and ensure completeness.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset was developed using nationally available data that are refreshed on an annual basis. Some discrepancies in the data may exist. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
