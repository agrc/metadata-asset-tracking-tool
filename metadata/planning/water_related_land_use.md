## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

Yearly layer of agricultural and other water-related land use and crop types in and around Utah. 2023

Cropland Data Layer (CDL) rasters from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) are downloaded for the appropriate year. https://nassgeodata.gmu.edu/CropScape/

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons representing agricultural areas and other water-related zones found in and around Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

These data are intended for planning purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the crop type and designated land use for a particular area. Other attributes describe the primary irrigation method, acreage, hydrologic basin and subarea of the polygon, and majority pixel value from the USDA [CDL Cropscape](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Research_and_Science/Cropland/SARS1a.php) raster layer.

### How was the dataset created?

Feature Classes are loaded onto tablet PCs and Field crews are sent to label the crop or land cover type and irrigation method for a subset of select fields or polygons. Each tablet PC is attached to a GPS unit for real-time tracking to continuously update the field crewâ€™s location during the field labeling process.

Digitizing is done as Geodatabase feature classes using ArcPro 3.1.0 with Sentinel imagery as a background with other layers added for reference. Updates to existing field boundaries of individual agricultural fields, urban areas and more are precisely digitized. Changes in irrigation type and land use are noted during this process.

Zonal Statistics geoprocessing tools are used to attribute the polygons with updated crop types from the CDL. The data is then run through several stages of comparison to historical inventories and quality checking in order to determine and produce the final attributes.
