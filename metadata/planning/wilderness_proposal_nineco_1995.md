## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

For regional analysis and display at 1:100,000 scale. This dataset was originally created as part of the formulation process that led to US House Bill HR1745.

This dataset represents proposed wilderness on BLM administered lands by the nine Utah counties which developed a proposal, with the 1995 State Trust Lands excluded. Each county independently defined areas for recommendation. Emery and San Juan counties also defined and proposed areas for non-wilderness protection. The source materials were at various scales and accuracies. The data were updated by AGRC with the Utah Trust Lands as they existed in 1995
