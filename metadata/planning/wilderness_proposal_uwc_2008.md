## Description

To show Utah Wilderness Coalition's Citizens' Wilderness Proposal for BLM lands in Utah updated in 2008

Utah Wilderness Coalition's Citizens' Wilderness Proposal for BLM lands in Utah updated in 2008. All proposed lands and human impacts were visited by staff and volunteers and documented on 1:24000 USGS quadrangles through field checking of each area by land or by aerial photo. This coverage shows all lands in the legislative proposal and lands that have wilderness quality but are not yet a part of the legislative proposal, America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. Note: To display this coverage make certain that those routes that are excluded from the wilderness proposal are displayed on top of the polygons. To do this, make certain to load the polygon and arc components of this coverage. Set polygon attribute uwc_prop = 1 to show those areas recommended in legislation for wilderness. Do not display the polygons labeled "0", these are OUT of the proposal. Set attribute uwc_prop = 2 for lands recommended by UWC for BLM wilderness designation that are not included in current legislation, uwc_prop = 3 for lands under consideration for addition to the proposal or in adjacent states, and uwc_prop = 4 for lands in field work review. uwc_prop = 5 is for lands that have been designed wilderness since 1998. Set the arc attribute prop_type to the same numbers.
