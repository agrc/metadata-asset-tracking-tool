## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas that were added to the Red Rock Wilderness Act proposal or considered for addition by the UWC.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons for areas proposed for wilderness designation in 2008 by the Utah Wilderness Coalition (UWC), as well as areas that were recommended for addition to the formal proposal but not fully included. For datasets of current areas designated as wilderness or under consideration, please see the [Utah Wilderness Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/wilderness/) and [BLM Wilderness Study Areas for Utah](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/blm-wilderness-study-areas/) layers.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Established in 1964, the [National Wilderness Preservation System](https://www.wilderness.org/articles/article/national-wilderness-preservation-system) allows for the protection and preservation of designated natural areas throughout the United States. This dataset contains areas that were formally proposed for wilderness designation or otherwise considered by the [Utah Wilderness Coalition](https://protectwildutah.org/) in 2008.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Wilderness area data are used for natural resource management, [NEPA](https://www.epa.gov/nepa) documentation, and recreational planning.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of a proposed wilderness area in Utah. Features in this dataset include the area name, region, last date revised, cluster, and acreage.

The status of an area is shown in the uwc_prop field, where:

- 1 = the area was proposed to legislation for wilderness designation
- 2 = the area was recommended by UWC for wilderness designation but was not formally proposed to legislation
- 3 = the area was/is under consideration for being added to the proposal, or the area is in a state other than Utah
- 4 = the area was/is under going field work review
- 5 = areas that have received wilderness designation since 1998.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the Utah Wilderness Association in collaboration with the BLM and UGRC.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains proposed wilderness areas previously considered by the BLM. This layer is intended for historic reference and does not reflect current wilderness or wilderness study area boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
