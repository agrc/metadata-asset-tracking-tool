## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas considered for wilderness designation by the Utah Wilderness Coalition as published in the book Wilderness on the Edge.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons for areas proposed for wilderness designation in 1989 by the Utah Wilderness Coalition (UWC). For datasets of current areas designated as wilderness or under consideration, please see the [Utah Wilderness Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/wilderness/) and [BLM Wilderness Study Areas for Utah](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/blm-wilderness-study-areas/) layers.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Established in 1964, the [National Wilderness Preservation System](https://www.wilderness.org/articles/article/national-wilderness-preservation-system) allows for the protection and preservation of designated natural areas throughout the United States. This dataset contains areas proposed for wilderness designation by the [Utah Wilderness Coalition](https://protectwildutah.org/) in 1989.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Wilderness area data are used for natural resource management, [NEPA](https://www.epa.gov/nepa) documentation, and recreational planning.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of a proposed wilderness area in Utah. Features in this dataset include the area name, division, and acreage.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the Utah Wilderness Association in collaboration with the BLM and UGRC. The original boundaries from UWC were published in the 1990 book Wilderness at the Edge: a Citizen Proposal to Protect Utah's Canyons and Deserts.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains proposed wilderness areas previously considered by the BLM. This layer is intended for historic reference and does not reflect current wilderness or wilderness study area boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
