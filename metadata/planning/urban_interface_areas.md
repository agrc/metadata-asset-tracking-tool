# Title

Utah Urban Interface Areas

## ID

7c75851d-eed3-4e8a-9f06-eb79cadafab7

## Brief Summary

Areas where wildland and human-developed areas coincide in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing approximate wildland-urban interface (WUI) areas in Utah as of a 1999 inventory. This dataset does not represent current fire conditions or community fire information.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The term Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) refers to areas where undeveloped land coincides with residential or commercial areas inhabited by humans. In some cases, these areas are at an increased risk for wildfire due to the intermingled nature of forest landscapes and human development. This dataset contains polygons representing areas defined as WUI by the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire, and State Lands as part of a 1999 inventory.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate area where WUI may exist. Features in this dataset include the fuel code, lot size, and acreage.

<!--- There are a number of fuel codes that exist, as well as fuel types. Do we know which of these this dataset utilizes? --->

### How was the dataset created?

<!--- I assume FFSL created this one with our help in some way? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents WUI areas as of a 1999 inventory and does not reflect current fire conditions or at-risk areas. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.

<!--- This is as far as I could tell from the original metadata. Are we intending to keep this layer up to date? --->
