Utah UWC 2008 Cherry Stem Roads

## ID

75a8684b-4ebe-47c6-a853-6f8504b03a58

## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of roads that cross wilderness areas but are not part of those wilderness areas.

## Summary

This dataset contains polyline features representing cherry stem roads in Wilderness Areas and Wilderness Study Areas as of 2008. This layer contains line geometry only and does not contain further details on access or road condition.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Cherry stem roads are sections of roads that cross through wilderness study areas or wilderness areas but fall outside the official boundary of those areas and are thus not included in Bureau of Land Management (BLM) management plans for wilderness areas. These roads may be paved or unpaved and may or not may not provide public access to and around wilderness areas.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general cartographic and reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each line in this dataset represents the approximate centerline of a cherry stem road.

### How was the dataset created?

<!--- Any ideas on how this dataset came to be? Going off the title, I'm assuming the Utah Wilderness Coalition was involved in some fashion. --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents cherry-stem roads as included in a 2008 report from the Utah Wilderness Coalition and may not reflect current cherry stem roads or wilderness area boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
