Utah Lidar Extents

## ID

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Lidar coverage areas in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons of areas where Lidar data has been collected in Utah. This dataset  does not include point clouds, Lidar-derived DEMs, or other data products.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Light Detection and Ranging, also known as [Lidar](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html), is a data collection method that produces high-resolution, three-dimensional representations of real-world objects and areas. Lidar is usually collected through airborne sensors which emit light pulses that measure distances to earth's surface. These pulses can be transformed into point clouds that are used to create elevation models, delineate geologic features, map buildings, and so much more. This dataset includes areas in and around Utah where Lidar data has been collected, processed, and made available to the public.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset displays geographic areas of Utah where users can find Lidar coverage. This dataset is suitable as a reference for current and past Lidar projects in Utah.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset displays areas of Lidar coverage as polygons. Each polygon represents a project area and includes the project name, date of completion, resolution, vertical accuracy, area in square miles, project status, and other attributes. These polygons do not include the Lidar point clouds themselves. Please visit [The National Map](https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/) data downloader to access point clouds. Other lidar data products are also available on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/documentation/sgid/exploring-lidar/).

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC compiled this dataset from project boundaries submitted to us by various data collection vendors. These boundaries include the original project area we sent to them with a buffer to ensure complete coverage of the area. UGRC maintains updates this dataset as new projects become available.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of Lidar extents in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this layer.
