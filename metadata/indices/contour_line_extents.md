# Title

Utah Contour Line Extents

## ID

7ccba6dc-5e8c-4249-a3f2-1bca0ec148ec

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas where contour lines are available for download in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing areas where contour lines are available for download through the [UGRC Raster Data Discovery](https://raster.utah.gov/) app. This dataset contains polygon extents only, for contour lines themselves, please visit the [Elevation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

A contour line joins several points of equal elevation above sea level. Lines are placed according to a set contour interval and are used to delineate areas of similar elevation values. UGRC has several contour datasets, including the [500 Foot Contour Lines](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/500-foot-contours/) layer and the [200 Foot Contour Polygons](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/200-foot-generalized-contours/) layer. This dataset shows the geographic extents of those contour line layers.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates a project area where contour lines have been delineated from a variety of data sources. Features in this dataset include the contour line interval, a short description of the data source, the year collected, file format and extension, area in square miles, as well as the point of contact for the project area.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset to show data extents on the Raster Data Discovery app.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset indicates approximate extents for contour lines only and does not contain elevation data. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
