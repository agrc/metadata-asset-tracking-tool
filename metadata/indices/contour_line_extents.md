# Title

Utah Contour Line Extents

## ID

7ccba6dc-5e8c-4249-a3f2-1bca0ec148ec

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Lidar and aerial photography project areas that were used to delineate contour lines.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing areas where contour line projects have been completed in Utah. These contour lines may have been derived from Lidar, aerial imagery, or other sources. This dataset contains polygon extents only, for contour lines themselves, please visit the [Elevation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

A contour line joins several points of equal elevation above sea level. Lines are placed according to a set contour interval and are used to delineate areas of similar elevation values. UGRC has several contour datasets, including the [500 Foot Contour Lines](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/500-foot-contours/) layer and the [200 Foot Contour Polygons](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/200-foot-generalized-contours/) layer.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates a project area where contour lines have been delineated from a variety of data sources. Features in this dataset include the contour line interval, a short description of the data source, the year collected, file format and extension, area in square miles, as well as the point of contact for the project area.

### How was the dataset created?

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset indicates approximate project areas for contour lines only and does not contain elevation data. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
