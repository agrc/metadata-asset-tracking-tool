# Title

Utah USGS 24K Quarter Quads

## ID

47b2c279-4981-4cce-b174-12a28c4e358f

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle quarters for topography and general analysis.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing quarter quadrangles used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) since 1947. This dataset contains quadrangle boundaries only and does not include topography data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Quadrangles are rectangular units of measurement in which the sides measure 7.5 minutes of latitude and 7.5 minutes of longitude. These quadrangles are divided into four equal parts to create the quarter quads found in this dataset. Quarter quadrangles are used in the creation of topographic maps and to represent data at the 1:24,000 scale. These boundaries are also coincident with the [National Agriculture Imagery Program](https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com/) (NAIP) tiles.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographic extent of a quarter quadrangle. Features in this dataset include the USGS tile name, area name, and cardinal direction relative to the original quadrangle.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this layer using data from USGS.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of USGS quarter quadrangles in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
