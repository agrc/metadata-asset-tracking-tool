Utah USGS 250k Quads 1x1

## ID

c9bb371d-6783-40ad-9c7c-87a9c9267ea1

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of USGS quadrangles measuring one degree latitude by one degree longitude for topography and general analysis.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing 1:250,000 scale quadrangles used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). This dataset contains quadrangle boundaries only and does not include topography data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Quadrangles in this dataset are rectangular units of measurement in which the sides measure one degree of latitude and one degree of longitude. These quadrangles are used in the creation of topographic maps and to represent data at a 1:250,000 scale.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographic extent of a quadrangle. Features in this dataset include the USGS tile name and USGS code.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this layer using data from USGS.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of USGS 1:250,000 1x1 quadrangles in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
