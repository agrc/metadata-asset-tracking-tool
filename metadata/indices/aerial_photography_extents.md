## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of aerial photography coverage areas in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons depicting aerial photography project extents in Utah. This dataset contains polygon extents only; aerial photography can be accessed through our [Discover](https://gis.utah.gov/products/discover/) aerial imagery and base map service.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Aerial photography, or aerial imagery, is a data collection method that involves taking a series of photographs from a plane or other airborne platform. These photographs can be mosaicked together to create maps, delineate features, and perform other kinds of data analyses.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of an aerial photography project Features in this dataset include a general description, the resolution, year collected, available file format, file size, file path, total square miles, and horizontal accuracy.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC compiled this dataset from project boundaries submitted to us by various data collection vendors. These boundaries include the original project area we sent to them with a buffer to ensure complete coverage of the area. UGRC maintains updates this dataset as new projects become available.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents polygon extents only and does not include aerial imagery or photography. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
