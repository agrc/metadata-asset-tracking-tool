## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Google Imagery Service boundaries and associated flight dates.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing project areas and completion dates for Google aerial imagery services. This dataset shows project boundary information only and does not include the imagery itself.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Aerial and satellite imagery is a powerful tool that can be used in data modeling, analysis, and cartography. This dataset shows areas in Utah where imagery has been collected, processed, and made available to the public through the Google imagery service.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset displays geographic areas of Utah where users can find aerial and satellite coverage. This dataset is suitable as a reference for current and past imagery projects in Utah.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset displays areas of imagery coverage as polygons. Each polygon represents a project area and includes the project name, date of completion, and year. These polygons do not include the mapped imagery themselves.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was provided to UGRC from Google. It was created by dissolving individual flight lines into blocks with the same flight date.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of Google imagery service areas and dates available in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this layer.
