## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of USNG blocks in and around Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing blocks in the United States National grid that cover Utah. This dataset contains boundary information only.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The United States National Grid is a nationally consistent, interoperable grid system that provides a frame of reference for determining location in GPS and GIS systems. You can learn more about the National Grid on the [Federal Geographic Data Committee](https://www.fgdc.gov/usng/how-to-read-usng) website.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each 1000 meter x 1000 meter polygon in this dataset indicates a block used in the National Grid system. Features in this dataset include the USNG ID number, USNG grid zone designator, 100,000 meter USNG square ID, lower left northing of each polygon, and lower left easting of each polygon.

### How was the dataset created?

The Center for Interdisciplinary Geospatial Information Technologies at Delta State University developed this layer in collaboration with the US Geological Survey under the cooperative agreement [07ERAG0083](https://usngcenter.org/fema-region-8/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of National Grid blocks in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
