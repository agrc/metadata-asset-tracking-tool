# Title

Utah Auto Correlated DEM Extents

## ID

7394cd31-96b3-4c78-907d-c44f0b342eed

## Brief Summary

Polygon extents of auto-correlated Digital Elevation Models collected in 2006.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons depicting the extent of auto-correlated bare-earth Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) available in Utah. This dataset contains polygon extents only; DEMs can be downloaded on the [UGRC website](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/auto-correlated-dem/).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are digital representations of a topographic surface. These models display elevation at the bare ground, excluding trees, buildings, and other surface objects. These raster data are used for a variety of purposes, including city and regional planning, general analyses, cartography, and natural resources studies. You can learn more about DEMs on the [USGS website](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-a-digital-elevation-model-dem#:~:text=A%20Digital%20Elevation%20Model%20(DEM)%20is%20a%20representation%20of%20the,derived%20primarily%20from%20topographic%20maps.).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of an available autocorrelated DEM. Features in this dataset include a general description, the resolution, year collected, available file format, file size, file path, total square mileage, and vertical/horizontal accuracy for each DEM extent.
