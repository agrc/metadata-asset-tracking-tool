# Title

Utah DRG Extents

## ID

3c56cb0e-96df-4815-bd40-d27e6f0bf761

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of geographic extents for USGS Digital Raster Graphic topographic maps.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing areas where USGS DRG topographic maps are available for download through the [UGRC Raster Data Discovery](https://raster.utah.gov/) app. This dataset contains polygon extents only and does not contain raster data itself.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Digital Raster Graphics (DRGs) are scanned, georeferenced images of topographic maps from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). You can learn more about DRGs through [official documentation](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1999/0070/report.pdf) on the USGS website.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of an available USGS DRG. Features in this dataset include a general description, the resolution, available file format, file size, file path, product type, product category, tile index, and total square miles for each DRG extent.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this layer using data available from USGS.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents polygon extents only and does not include topography maps or data. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
