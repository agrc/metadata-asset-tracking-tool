Utah Contours 500 Foot

## ID

db2b6974-37b6-41d6-b363-47f9756d3a77

## Brief Summary

Statewide contour lines to display relative elevation and terrain at medium scales.

## Summary

This dataset contains polylines representing elevation contour lines placed at 500 foot intervals. These data represent approximate elevation values only. For other elevation products such as [Digital Elevation Models](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/usgs-3d-elevation-program/) (DEM), please see the [Elevation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/) available on our website.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

A contour line joins several points of equal elevation above sea level. Lines are placed according to a set contour interval, which for this dataset, is 500 feet. These lines can be used to show the general topography of an area.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This resource has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each line in this dataset indicates a change in elevation from the surrounding lines. Lines that are closer together indicate a steeper slope. Features in this dataset include the elevation value for the line.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by first generalizing a 30 meter digital elevation model with a focal filter. We then reclassified the output raster in order to group elevations into 500 foot intervals. You can read more about this process on [our blog](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2017-11-27-dumbing-down-terrain-with-contour-polygons/#dumbing-down-terrain-with-contour-polygons).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

UGRC has made this dataset available to the public as a cartographic resource. This dataset does not reflect exact elevation values within the state of Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
