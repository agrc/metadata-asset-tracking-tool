## Brief Summary

Points dataset of the top one hundred tallest peaks in Utah as measured from sea level.

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations for Utah's top one hundred tallest mountain peaks. This dataset contains approximate points only and does not include further information such as recreational trails or visitation regulations. Further elevation datasets can be found in the [Elevation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations of the top 100 tallest peaks in Utah as measured from sea level. This dataset also includes a few additional points that represent the tallest peak in a given county.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

UGRC developed this dataset to support the creation of the [Utah Terrain Base Map](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/base-maps/terrain/), one of many base maps available through the [UGRC Discover service](https://gis.utah.gov/products/discover/). This dataset has been made available to the public for general cartographic and reference purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the approximate location of one of Utah's tallest peaks. Features in this dataset include the name of the mountain, elevation, and county. UGRC has also included a rank field that shows the top 100 peaks in order. Peaks in with a zero in the 'rank' field are the highest peaks in their respective counties but are not counted among the highest 100 peaks for the entire state of Utah.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using peak names and elevation data from the USGS [Geographic Names Information System](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis). Points were placed on or near the highest point on each peak.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The points in this dataset indicate approximate peak locations only. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
