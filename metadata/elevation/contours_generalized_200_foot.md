# Title

Utah Contours Generalized 200 Foot

## ID

5764983f-2481-41cf-974c-38dd91e98552

## Brief Summary

Generalized contour polygons to display relative elevation and terrain at medium and small scales.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing elevation contour lines placed at 200 foot intervals. These data represent approximate elevation values only. For other elevation products such as [Digital Elevation Models](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/usgs-3d-elevation-program/) (DEM), please see the [Elevation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/elevation/) available on our website.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Contour polygons are created when the area between two elevation contour lines is filled in and digitized. This filled-in area represents a zone of elevation that can be used for cartographic and basic analytic purposes.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Contour polygons are to be used as a cartographic elevation layer which reflect the approximate elevation of an area.

<!--- Are there other specific uses for this dataset? --->

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this layer indicates an area with similar elevation values. Features in this layer include the average elevation for the polygon and the minimum and maximum range of values within the polygon.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by first generalizing a 30 meter digital elevation model with a focal filter. We then reclassified the output raster in order to group elevations into 200 foot intervals. Finally, we converted these intervals into polygons to produce this final layer.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

UGRC has made this dataset available to the public as a cartographic resource. This dataset does not reflect exact elevation values within the state of Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
