## Brief Summary

Generalized contour polygons to show relative elevation and terrain at medium and small scales.

Generalized contour polygons to show relative elevation and terrain at medium and small scales. Contour polygons are to be used as a general elevation layer which may or may not reflect the actual elevation of a location.

Contours were created by first generalizing a 30 meter digital elevation model with a focal filter. The output raster was then reclassified to group elevations into 200 foot intervals and finally converted into polygons. Contour polygons represent an approximate elevation.
