## ID

5764983f-2481-41cf-974c-38dd91e98552

## Brief Summary

Generalized contour polygons to show relative elevation and terrain at medium and small scales.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing elevation contour lines placed at 200 foot intervals.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Generalized contour polygons to show relative elevation and terrain at medium and small scales. Contour polygons are to be used as a general elevation layer which may or may not reflect the actual elevation of a location.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates an area with roughly the same elevation. Features in this dataset include the average elevation for the polygon and the range.

### How was the dataset created?

Contours were created by first generalizing a 30 meter digital elevation model with a focal filter. The output raster was then reclassified to group elevations into 200 foot intervals and finally converted into polygons. Contour polygons represent an approximate elevation.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?
