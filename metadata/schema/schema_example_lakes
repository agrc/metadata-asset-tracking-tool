### GNIS_ID

Unique identifier associated with each feature as recorded in the [GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis).

### GNIS_NAME

Water body name found in the [GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis).

### Area_SqKm

The area of the body of water in square kilometers.

### Elevation

### ReachCode

From the [Environmental Protection Agency](https://enviro.epa.gov/enviro/ef_metadata_html.tri_page?p_column_name=reach_code#:~:text=Description%3A%20A%20reach%20code%20is,National%20Hydrography%20Dataset%20(NHD).): “A reach code is a unique 14-digit code that identifies a continuous piece of surface water with similar hydrologic characteristics. It is assigned to each receiving water body by the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).” Reach addresses establish the locations of features relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets.

### FType

A three-digit code that can be used to classify water body features by [NHD functional type](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains). The Ftype informs the user as to what type of water body the feature is.

### Ftype_text

Associated text for the Ftype code.

### FCode

A six-digit code that can be used to classify water body features by [NHD functional type](https://www.usgs.gov/index.php/ngp-standards-and-specifications/national-hydrography-dataset-nhd-data-dictionary-feature-domains). The Fcode informs the user what type of water body the feature is, whether the feature is perennial, and its elevation type.

### FCode_Text

Associated text for the Fcode.

### InUtah
