## Brief Summary

VISTA precinct ballot area boundaries

## Summary

The official voting precincts used by Utah's VISTA election framework.

## Description

Vista Ballot Areas are voting precincts for all 29 counties in Utah.

### What is the dataset?

Voting precincts determine a voter's ballot composition and polling location based on the boundaries of all political districts covering their address (U.S Congress, State House and Senate, state school board, municipal districts, special districts, etc) in conjunction with a legislatively-mandated maximum limit of voters per precinct.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset drives many of the State's voter information pages and lookups.

### What does the dataset represent?

A 'Dissolve' operation on the PRECINCTID field will produce precinct polygons without subprecinct lines.

### How was the dataset created?

Precincts boundaries are submitted by County Clerk offices. Where precincts are split into formal subprecincts, only the subprecincts are included in this dataset.

Updates are done to the precincts periodically, corresponding with Annexations and city/town boundary changes.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?
