## Brief Summary

United States House of Representatives Districts for Utah defined after every decennial census.

## Summary

This dataset contains United States House of Representatives Districts found in Utah for the years 2022-2032. Statewide district boundaries are drawn by the [Utah State Legislature](https://le.utah.gov/) after each decennial census and adopted into State law.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The United States House of Representatives is comprised of 435 members, four of which represent Utah as elected members of Congress. This feature class represents the four Congressional Districts in Utah that will be used from 2022 to 2032. General voter precinct boundaries are not found in this dataset, but can be found in the [Utah Ballot Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/political/voter-precincts/) dataset available on the SGID.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The data will be used for election purposes beginning January 1, 2022. Elected officials began representing these districts in January 2023. These boundaries supersede the US Congress districts that were used in 2012-2021. This dataset also helps citizens [find their senators](https://le.utah.gov/GIS/findDistrict.jsp) and is suitable for general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic boundary that a given elected official represents. The DISTRICT field contains the US Congress district number. This dataset does not contain names or information for current elected officials.

### How was the dataset created?

The Utah State Legislature draws statewide political district boundaries per [HB2004](https://le.utah.gov/~2021s2/bills/static/HB2004.html). These districts were adopted into state law as part of the decennial redistricting process that began in 2021. The boundaries in this dataset will eventually be superseded by new data drawn from the 2030 Census.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the official boundaries used by the Utah Legislature for the years 2022-2032. It is the most current source for these boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
