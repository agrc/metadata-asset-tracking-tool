## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of House of Representatives districts for the years 2022-2032.

## Summary

This dataset contains Utah House of Representatives district boundaries for the years 2022-2032. Statewide House district boundaries are drawn by the [Utah State Legislature](https://le.utah.gov/) after each decennial Census and adopted into State law.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The [Utah House of Representatives](https://house.utleg.gov/about-the-house/) is comprised of 75 Representatives elected to two-year terms. This dataset shows the geographic boundaries of House districts that will be used from 2022 to 2032.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The data will be used for election purposes beginning January 1, 2022. Elected officials began representing these districts in January 2023. These boundaries supersede the State House Districts that were used in 2012-2021. This dataset also helps citizens [find their representatives](https://le.utah.gov/GIS/findDistrict.jsp) and is suitable for general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic boundary that a given House member represents. The DIST field contains the House district number. UGRC also included the COLOR4 field so that you can recolor the polygons so that no two adjacent districts display with the same color.

### How was the dataset created?

The Utah State Legislature draws statewide political district boundaries per [HB2005](https://le.utah.gov/~2021S2/bills/hbillint/HB2005.pdf). These districts are adopted into state law as part of the decennial redistricting process that began in 2021.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the official boundaries used by the Utah Legislature for the years 2022-2032. It is the most current source for these boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
