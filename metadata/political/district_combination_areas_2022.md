## Brief Summary

The unique combination of Utah's state legislative, school board, and congressional districts defined after every decennial census.

Utah District Combination Areas 2022 is the geographic union of all 4 political districts including the House, Senate, U.S. Congressional, and School Board districts, creating many different polygons each with its own unique combination of the input layers.

The Congress, House, School, and Senate fields contain the associated district number.

The COLOR4, COLOR4_House, COLOR4_Senate, and COLOR4_SB fields can be used in coloring districts using only 4 colors, usually with no adjacent district displayed with the same color. This may not always be the case due to the number and size of the districts.

Statewide political district boundaries are drawn by the Utah Legislature after each decennial census and adopted into state law.
