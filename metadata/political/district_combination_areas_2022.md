## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of the combination of Utah legislative, school board, and congressional districts.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing the combination of Utah's state legislative, school board, and congressional districts defined after every decennial census. Separate polygon boundaries for the Utah House of Representatives, Senate, and school districts can be found on the [Political Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/political/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Utah District Combination Areas 2022 is the geographic union of the House, Senate, U.S. Congressional, and School Board districts. Each polygon created by this union contains a unique combination of the input layers.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

<!--- Gathering more information on this. --->

### What does the dataset represent?

The Congress, House, School, and Senate fields of each polygon contain the associated district number. The COLOR4, COLOR4_House, COLOR4_Senate, and COLOR4_SB fields can be used in coloring districts using only 4 colors, usually with no adjacent district displayed with the same color. This may not always be the case due to the number and size of the districts.

### How was the dataset created?

Statewide political district boundaries are drawn by the [Utah Legislature](https://le.utah.gov/) after each decennial census and adopted into state law.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of district boundaries. Upcoming data from the 2030 Census will be uploaded into a separate dataset. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
