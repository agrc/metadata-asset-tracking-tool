## Summary

Utah Law Enforcement contains locations where law enforcement officers are regularly based or stationed. Law enforcement agencies may include municipal police, county sheriffs, school police, and federal law enforcement agencies. Additionally, this dataset includes departments within non-law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority Police).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Law enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics [(LEMAS)](https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/law-enforcement-management-and-administrative-statistics-lemas) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non-federal agencies, this dataset includes locations for federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies.

<!--- LEMAS was mentioned in the original dataset, so I kept it in, but other than being another helpful resource for those looking for law enforcement data, I'm not sure why it was specifically mentioned. -->

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to provide a general purpose database of law enforcement facility locations. Law enforcement facility data can been used to asses whether the total police capability of a given area is adequate and to help local governments identify areas of greatest concern. The data are also a helpful resource for situational awareness planning, emergency response, and route analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset is comprised of point data indicating the locations of law enforcement facilities throughout the state of Utah. Each point includes attributes such as the facility name, street address, and date it was added to the dataset (indicated by the CONTDATE field). Points have been placed on or near the main structure of the facility.

### How was the dataset created?

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset previously included home addresses for constables who work out of their private residence, temporary offices, and FBI entities. The most recent version of this dataset excludes these facilities, however, some discrepancies may still exist.
