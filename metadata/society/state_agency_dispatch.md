## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Department of Public Safety Communications Bureau serves as the dispatch partner for many state agencies, including Utah Highway Patrol, the Division of Wildlife Resources, and the Department of Corrections. Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic extent of each dispatch center's area of responsibility. It does not include the specific locations of law enforcement facilities or dispatch centers.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is primarily used in emergency services and public safety. Dispatch zones help determine which of the six [Public Communications centers](https://dps.utah.gov/dispatch/) in Utah will dispatch personnel from various state agencies. It also serves as a cartographic reference and is suitable for general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Areas of responsibility for each Department of Public Communications Center in this dataset are represented as polygons and are labelled with the corresponding dispatch center.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset based on information provided by the Communications Centers. We maintain this layer in collaboration with the Communications Centers and update the data as county or municipality boundaries change.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of dispatch zones for state agencies in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with any other questions or concerns about this dataset.
