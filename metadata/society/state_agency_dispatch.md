## Summary

This dataset displays the areas of responsibility for the State Department of Public Communications Centers for dispatching state agencies, such as Utah Highway Patrol and the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Department of Public Safety Communications Bureau serves as the dispatch partner for many state agencies, including Utah Highway Patrol, the Division of Wildlife Resources, and the Department of Corrections. Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic extent of each dispatch center's area of responsibility. It does not include the specific locations of law enforcement facilities or dispatch centers.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is primarily used in emergency services and public safety. Dispatch zones help determine which Public Communications dispatch center will respond to a 911 caller, per Next Generation 911 ([NG911](https://www.911.gov/issues/ng911/)) guidelines. You can learn more about how geospatial data are used in emergency response on our [blog](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-04-09-ugrc-ng911-update/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Areas of responsibility for each Department of Public Communications Center in this dataset are represented as polygons and are labelled with the corresponding dispatch center.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset based on information provided by the Communications Centers.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of dispatch zones for state agencies in Utah.
