## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah State Court System includes appellate courts such as the Utah Supreme Court, trial courts such as the District and Juvenile Courts, and other administrative bodies such as the Administrative Office of the Court. This dataset contains polygon boundaries for trial court jurisdictions in Utah, which are organized into eight judicial districts throughout the State. These judicial districts include many city and county courts and handle a wide variety of cases. You can learn more about judicial districts and their responsibilities on the [Utah State Courts website](https://www.utcourts.gov/en/about.html).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

In addition to helping Utah residents know [which State Court District](https://www.utcourts.gov/en/about/miscellaneous/directory/map-of-judicial-districts.html) they are in, this dataset is used by the Utah Department of Safety for planning and analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

### How was the dataset created?

We derived the boundary data from the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) dataset available on the SGID. We update this dataset as new information becomes available.
