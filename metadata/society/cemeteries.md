## Brief Summary

Points dataset of public historic and modern cemeteries in Utah derived from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office.

## Summary

For further information on cemetery and burial records in Utah, please visit the [Utah State Historic Preservation Office](https://ushpo.utah.gov/cemetery/) website.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains points representing the approximate locations of cemeteries and burial grounds in Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to support the [Utah Cemeteries Web Application](https://utahshpo.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=e51da778246f4720ad4266e30095be45) available from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset indicates the approximate center of a cemetery in Utah. Features in this dataset include the cemetery name, city, county, number of burials, address, general directions, point of contact, cemetery owner, phone number, year established, and status.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the Utah State Historic Preservation Office using historic and current burial records.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

<!--- In OpenData we have two datasets for cemetery points, this one and one called SHPO cemeteries. The SHPO Cemeteries one seems to have more points, so I assume it's more up to date. Does this dataset have a particular purpose that is not being served by the SHPO Cemeteries dataset? --->
