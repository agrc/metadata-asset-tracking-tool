## Description

### What is the dataset?

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Originally developed for the Utah Department of Public Safety Bureau of Investigations, this dataset is also a helpful resource for city planning and legal analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of a particular city court's jurisdiction. This dataset recognizes the court with responsibility over that municipality but does not offer further details such as the current judge or what responsibilities the court has.

### How was the dataset created?

Information identifying cities that have a court was provided by the Utah Courts Administrative Office. Polygon boundaries are the [municipal boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/municipal/) found in the SGID.

Periodic boundary changes will be made as municipal boundaries change and responsibilities of city courts will be updated as they become known.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most complete and current version of city court jurisdictions categorized by municipal boundary.
