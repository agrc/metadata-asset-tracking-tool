Polygon boundaries of city court jurisdiction areas.

## Summary

This dataset was developed for the Utah Department of Public Safety [Bureau of Investigations](https://sbi.utah.gov/) for use in planning operations throughout the State. It indicates which city court has responsibility in a particular municipality.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

City courts such as the [Salt Lake City Justice Court](https://www.slc.gov/courts/) or the [Provo City Court](https://www.provo.org/departments/justice-court#9188_14945_382_341) generally handle cases such class B and C misdemeanors, traffic offenses, and other small claims matters. This dataset displays which city court has jurisdiction over a particular area, but does not specify the location of courthouses or other judicial buildings.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is a helpful resource for city planning and legal analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of a particular city court's jurisdiction. This dataset does not offer further details such as the current judge or what responsibilities the court has in that area.

### How was the dataset created?

Information identifying cities that have a court was provided by the Utah Courts Administrative Office. Polygon boundaries in this layer are derived from the [Municipal Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/municipal/) dataset found in the SGID.

UGRC collaborate with local authorities to update this dataset as changes are made to municipal boundaries or court jurisdiction areas.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most complete and current version of city court jurisdictions. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with any questions or concerns about this dataset.
