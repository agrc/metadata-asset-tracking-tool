## Summary

Utah Law Enforcement Locations contains facilities where law enforcement officers are regularly based or stationed. Law enforcement agencies may include municipal police, county sheriffs, school police, and federal law enforcement agencies. Additionally, this dataset includes departments within non-law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority Police).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The US Bureau of Justice Statistics describes law enforcement agencies as "publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This dataset includes point locations for federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agency facilities.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to provide a general purpose database of law enforcement facility locations. Law enforcement facility data can been used to asses whether the total police capability of a given area is adequate and to help local governments identify areas of greatest concern. The data are also a helpful resource for situational awareness planning, emergency response, and route analysis. A version of this data is also used to map [Firearm Safe Harbor Storage Locations](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/d7e5683828c449c29561f9921d5d16d1).

### What does the dataset represent?

The points in this dataset indicate the locations of law enforcement facilities (police stations, sheriff's offices, etc.) throughout the state of Utah. Each point includes attributes such as the facility name, street address, contact information, city, zip, county, and coordinates. Points have been placed on or near the main structure of the facility.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC originally derived this dataset from the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database maintained by the [US Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/). The primary source for this database was the 2008 [Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/census-state-and-local-law-enforcement-agencies-2008). The data are currently maintained by UGRC in collaboration with the Department of [Public Safety's Bureau of Criminal Identification (BCI)](https://bci.utah.gov/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?
