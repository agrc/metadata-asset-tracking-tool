## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes large and small facilities, as well as ones that are open year-round or only seasonally.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available for general cartographic and analytic purposes.

<!--- This dataset feels like it was made for something specific, do we know what that might be? Or is it just general reference for state buildings? --->

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset was placed on or near the main structure of the state-owned facility. Features in this dataset include attributes such as the building name, agency ID, type, address, organization, and year the building was constructed.

<!--- There's also a few attributes such as risk_number and risk_man that seem to hint at a specific purpose this dataset may serve. Do we know what some of these fields mean? --->

### How was the dataset created?

<!--- The data page for this layer refers to the Division of Facilities Construction Management as well as OSM, were either of these used in the creation of this dataset? Do we know how this dataset was created? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains a wide variety of locations but may not contain all locations of a certain type owned by the State. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
