### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was built in collaboration with Wasatch Front Regional Council(WFRC), the Utah State Board of Education (USBE), and the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC).

This dataset will be updated annually in conjunction with USBE's annual report.

The tabular portion of the data was downloaded from USBE's data page. The list of fields and the data in this dataset were generated by joining the following USBE reports:

2019-2020 School List
Fall 2019-2020 Enrollment by Demographics and Grade Levels
Geographic Data
Point locations (geometry) were generated from USBE's school list using the UGRC Geocoding Web API, opens in a new tab which utilizes address point and street centerline reference data. These were then compared to the previous 2016-2017 school layer's locations with the best position chosen. Unmatched addresses were hand placed with assistance from publicly available, commercial mapping and search web apps.
