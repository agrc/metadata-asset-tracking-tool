## Brief Summary

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations for preschool and K-12 schools in the state of Utah - updated for the 2019-2020 school year. Higher education and adult vocational training are not included in the dataset.

This dataset was built in collaboration with Wasatch Front Regional Council(WFRC), the Utah State Board of Education (USBE), and the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC). The dataset includes public and private K-12 school locations with enrollment and demographics info by grade for public schools (charter and traditional) reported to the USBE. While some preschools are included, this is not a comprehensive statewide dataset for preschools.

Schools marked as 'closed' have not been included in this data. More information regarding schools in Utah can be found on the Utah State Board of Education website.

This dataset will be updated annually in conjunction with USBE's annual report.
