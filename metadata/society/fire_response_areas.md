Utah Fire Response Areas

## ID

8c3b511c-6314-4d8f-ab33-f48c2bd0a08f

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas of responsibility for fire response agencies in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing fire response areas in Utah and depicts the primary response agency for a given location. Emergency response boundaries for incidents unrelated to fire can be found on the [EMS Response Areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/society/emergency-medical-response-areas/) dataset available in the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset represents the primary agency, typically a local fire department, that will respond to fire-related emergency at a given location. The response areas represent career and volunteer fire departments at a variety of levels including local, municipal, county, state, and federal, as well as a few private or industrial organizations.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The dataset was created to provide response recommendations for Next Generation 911 (NG911) systems that are being implemented across Utah. Next Generation 911 represents a national effort to upgrade and streamline emergency calling and dispatch systems with geospatial data at the core. You can learn more about NG911 systems through the [911 website](https://www.911.gov/issues/ng911/video-benefits-of-next-generation-911/) and on [our blog](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2017-12-28-utah-ng911-gis-database/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature in this dataset indicates the agency or department that will respond to a fire-related emergency in the area bounded by the polygon. The majority of the fields are based on data collection and maintenance [standards](https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.nena.org/resource/resmgr/Standards/NENA_02-014.1_GIS_Data_Colle.pdf) for NG911 from the [National Emergency Number Association](https://www.nena.org/) (NENA). UGRC also added a Fire Department ID field (FDID) to asist with cost recovery and the federal funding process.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this dataset using Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) data from a variety of sources throughout the state, including municipalities, counties, and the Utah Division of Forestry, FIre, and State Lands ([FFSL](https://ffsl.utah.gov/)). The Fire Department IDs (FDIDs) were added to the dataset using tabular data from the Utah State Fire Marshal and US Fire Administration. This dataset is currently maintained by UGRC in partnership with local, state, and federal government authorities.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of fire response boundaries in Utah.  Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
