## Brief Summary

## Summary

Purpose: This dataset contains a polygon representation of fire response areas in Utah, intended to depict the primary response agency for a given location.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Fire Response Areas in Utah represent the primary agency, typically a local fire department, that will respond to fire-related emergencies at a given location. The response areas represent career and volunteer fire departments at a variety of levels including local, municipal, county, state, and federal agencies, as well as a few private or industrial organizations.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The dataset was created to provide response recommendations for the Next-Generation 911 system and was compiled from a variety of data sources.

### What does the dataset represent?

Field Descriptions

Most of the fields are based on the National Emergency Number Association's (NENA) Standard for NG911 GIS Data Model. An additional Fire Department ID (FDID) field was added to assist with cost recovery and federal funding processes. The FDIDs were added to the data after the most recent lists from the Utah State Fire Marshal and US Fire Administration were cross-referenced and combined into a single list.

### How was the dataset created?

The dataset was built from computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data within the state, tax entities, municipal boundaries, county boundaries, land ownership, inputs from Utah Forestry, Fire, and State Lands (FFSL), and other datasets.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?
