## Description

### What is the dataset?

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This data set was developed for the Utah Department of Public Safety Bureau of Investigations for use in planning operations throughout the State.

### What does the dataset represent?

### How was the dataset created?

Identification of local police departments was obtained from the Utah Chiefs of Police Association and from associated 911 dispatch centers. Boundaries for the police departments are the current municipal boundaries in the SGID. Periodic boundary boundary changes will be made as municipal boundaries change and responsibilities of city police departments will be updated as they become known. Sheriffs Office boundaries are current county boundaries in the SGID minus local police department boundaries.
