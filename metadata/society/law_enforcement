# Title

Utah Law Enforcement

<!--- thought: should the title say "Utah Law Enforcement Facilities"? That's what it says in the link, but on the data page it is just "Utah Law Enforcement" which seems vague to me. -->

## Brief Summary

Point locations of facilities where officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly stationed.

## Summary

Utah Law Enforcement contains locations where officers of a law enforcement agency are regularly based or stationed. Law enforcement agencies include, but are not limited to, municipal police, county sheriffs, school police, railroad police, federal law enforcement agencies, departments within non law enforcement federal agencies charged with law enforcement (e.g., US Postal Inspectors), and cross jurisdictional authorities (e.g., Port Authority Police).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Law enforcement agencies "are publicly funded and employ at least one full-time or part-time sworn officer with general arrest powers". This is the definition used by the US Department of Justice - Bureau of Justice Statistics (DOJ-BJS) for their Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics [(LEMAS)](https://bjs.ojp.gov/data-collection/law-enforcement-management-and-administrative-statistics-lemas) survey. Although LEMAS only includes non-federal agencies, this dataset includes locations for federal, state, local, and special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to provide a general purpose database of law enforcement facility locations. Law enforcement facility data can been used to asses whether the total police capability of a a given area is adequate and to help local governments identify areas of greatest concern. These data are also a helpful resource for situational awareness planning, emergency response, and route analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset is comprised of point data indicating the locations of law enforcement facilities throughout the state of Utah. Each point includes the facility name, street address, and date it was added to the dataset (indicated by the CONTDATE field). Points have been placed on or near the main structure of the facility.

<!--- Are the points the same as the address points? -->

### How was the dataset created?

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset has previously included home addresses for constables who work out of their private residence, temporary offices, and FBI entities. These facilities are excluded from this dataset in the most recent version, however, some discrepancies may still exist. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset, or if you notice any such discrepancies.
