Homeland Security Use Cases: Use cases describe how the data may be used and help to define and clarify requirements. 1. A threat to cause the mass release of prisoners by an outside terrorist group has been identified. Steps need to be taken to provide extra security at the targeted prisons. 2. Massive civil unrest has resulted in a large number of arrests. Appropriate space is needed outside of the immediate area to house the arrested individuals. 3. Massive civil unrest has resulted in a large number of arrests. A "holding camp" has been established to hold those arrested. Trained security guards are needed to staff the holding camp. 4. A disaster has caused the need for an emergency labor force (e.g., sandbagging during a flood) and prisoners may fill that need. 5. Inmates may need to be evacuated, or appropriate steps may need to be taken at a prison to protect the inmates and to ensure that a disaster does not present an opportunity for escape.

Jails and Prisons (Correctional Institutions). The Jails and Prisons sub-layer is part of the Emergency Law Enforcement Sector and the Critical Infrastructure Category. A Jail or Prison consists of any facility or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained against their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as well as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Work camps, including camps operated seasonally, are included if they otherwise meet the definition. A Federal Prison is a facility operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the incarceration of individuals. A State Prison is a facility operated by a state, commonwealth, or territory of the US for the incarceration of individuals for a term usually longer than 1 year. A Juvenile Detention Facility is a facility for the incarceration of those who have not yet reached the age of majority (usually 18 years). A Local Jail is a locally administered facility that holds inmates beyond arraignment (usually 72 hours) and is staffed by municipal or county employees. A temporary holding facility, sometimes referred to as a "police lock up" or "drunk tank", is a facility used to detain people prior to arraignment. Locations that are administrative offices only are excluded from the dataset. This definition of Jails is consistent with that used by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in their "National Jail Census", with the exception of "temporary holding facilities", which the DOJ excludes. Locations which function primarily as law enforcement offices are included in this dataset if they have holding cells. AGRC has made a concerted effort to include all correctional institutions.

This dataset is comprised completely of license free data.

Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries.

"#" and "*" characters were automatically removed from standard fields that TGS populated. Double spaces were replaced by single spaces in these same fields.

Text fields in this dataset have been set to all upper case to facilitate consistent database engine search results.

All diacritics (e.g., the German umlaut or the Spanish tilde) have been replaced with their closest equivalent English character to facilitate use with database systems that may not support diacritics.
