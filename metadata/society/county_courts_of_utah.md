## Summary

This dataset was developed for the Utah Department of Public Safety [Bureau of Investigations](https://sbi.utah.gov/) for use in planning operations throughout the State. It indicates which county court has responsibility in a particular area.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

County courts, similar to [city courts](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah::city-courts-of-utah/about), generally handle cases such class B and C misdemeanors, traffic offenses, and other small claims matters. This dataset displays which county court has jurisdiction over an area, but does not specify the location of courthouses or other judicial buildings.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is used largely by the Utah Department of Public Safety for planning and analysis. It has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of a county court's jurisdiction. This dataset does not offer further details such as the current judge or what responsibilities the court has in that area.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was developed using boundary data from the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) dataset available on the SGID.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most complete and current version of county court jurisdictions. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with any questions or concerns about this dataset.
