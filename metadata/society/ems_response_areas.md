### What does the dataset represent?

### How was the dataset created?

and was compiled from a variety of data sources. The data was compiled using written descriptions from the licensing database of the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and Preparedness ([BEMSP](https://ems.utah.gov/)), which is part of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services ([DHHS](https://dhhs.utah.gov/)). In some instances, the BEMSP data was incomplete or the written descriptions were inaccurate, contradictory, ambiguous, or failed to close. To make the data more complete, computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data from within the state was used to resolve conflicts, fill in gaps, and improve completeness.
