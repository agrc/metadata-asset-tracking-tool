## Summary

This dataset represents the primary facilities where emergency 911 calls are taken.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes point locations placed on or near the main structure of a PSAP facility. These locations are used to determine which communications center will receive a given 911 call.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is a central component of public safety planning and emergency response management in Utah. Communications centers utilize PSAP data to direct 911 calls to the nearest communication center as based on the caller's IP address. This dataset is just one of many used in emergency response; further resources and 911 data can be found on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/solutions/for-emergency-response/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the location of a PSAP communications center and contain attributes such as the center name, address, and phone number.

### How was the dataset created?

The original dataset was created in December 2004 by geocoding the PSAP addresses provided by the [E911](https://www.fcc.gov/general/9-1-1-and-e9-1-1-services) Executive Committee. Today, this dataset is maintained by UGRC in collaboration with local county and municipal authorities. Primary PSAP locations are concurrent with locations found on the [911 Master PSAP Registry](https://www.fcc.gov/general/9-1-1-master-psap-registry) maintained by the Federal Communications Commission.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of PSAP facilities in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
