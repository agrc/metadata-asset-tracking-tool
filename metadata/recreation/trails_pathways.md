## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of established non-motorized trails in Utah.

## Summary

The Utah Trails and Pathways map layer represents off-street features and important road connections that augment Utah's recreational trail and transportation network. This map layer features many of Utah's trails and pathways but is not yet complete.

This trails map layer represents off-road recreational trail features and important road connections that augment Utah’s recreational trail network. This map layer features many of Utah’s recreational trails but is not yet complete. Currently, the trails information primary depicts trails used by hiking and mountain biker users.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset depicts trail and pathway features used by hikers/pedestrians and bikers. It specifies the primary use of the trail with the CartoCode identifier.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

### What does the dataset represent?

Presently, the planned approach for on street bicycle lanes and routes is to incorporate them in the the statewide roads GIS layer using left and right side attributes. On street bike infrastructure is not expected to be represented in this map layer.

This trails map layer represents name, location, and allowed use information for Utah off-road recreational trail features and important road connections that augment the off-road trails. This map layer features over 20,000 miles of Utah’s recreational trails, it is not yet complete.

### How was the dataset created?

It began with map data purchased from a private entity (Orbital View, Inc), for which full rights werCe purchased by the GOED Office of Outdoor Recreation in July 2014. Since the original purchase, subsequent substantive updates have included: 2014 Revisions from National Park service; 2015 additions from Emery County; June 2016 additions from Cache County US Forest Service Geodata Hub (all forests except Sawtooth in NW Box Elder County), and Mountainland Association of Governments (Utah and Wasatch counties); 2018/2019 additions as part of the multimodal project; and currently ongoing updates by WFRC transportation planners.

Significant updates were made in 2018 as part of the multimodal project. These included pathways and off-road bike trails in the project area. Additional trails can be submitted to Utah UGRC for inclusion in this map layer.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Although it is a work in progress, this dataset represents a substantial starting point to integrate additional trail systems from other local, state, and federal agencies. The success of this effort will rely heavily on local government and land stewards to review and continue to improve upon this data. Additional segments can be submitted to UGRC for inclusion in this dataset.
