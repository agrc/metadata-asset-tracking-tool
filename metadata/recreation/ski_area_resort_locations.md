## Brief Summary

## Summary

Point locations for each of Utah’s alpine ski areas and resorts for planning and other general purposes. Created by staff of Utah AGRC.

Locations for each of Utah’s alpine ski areas and resorts are represented as points for Alta, Beaver Mountain, Brian Head, Brighton, Cherry Peak, Deer Valley, Eagle Point, Park City, Powder Mountain, Snowbasin, Snowbird, Solitude, Sundance and Wolf Mountain. Points have been placed on or near base area parking/facilities when possible, but are designed for use in statewide or other small-scale maps, and as use for label points. This dataset reflects current locations for the 2016-17 season and was created by digitizing points on top of high resolution aerial photography.
