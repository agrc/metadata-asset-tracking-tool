## Summary

Utah golf course polygons were compiled based on the Utah Golf Association's (UGA) list of golf courses. Golf courses were digitized from aerial photography and assigned name, city, county, holes, par, and type attributes.

It should be noted that this is based on the Utah Golf Association's website list of golf courses, golf course websites, and other public data and may be incomplete.
