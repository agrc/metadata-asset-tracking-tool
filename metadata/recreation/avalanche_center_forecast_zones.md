Utah Avalanche Center Forecast Zones

## ID

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of zones used by the Utah Avalanche Center to issue avalanche condition forecasts in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset includes polygon boundaries for the Utah Avalanche Center (UAC) Forecast Zones found within Utah. This dataset includes forecast zones only and does not include current forecast or hazard information. For current information, users are encouraged to visit the [UAC website](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/) or join forecast data from [UAC's API](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/docs/api/forecast) to the forecast zones polygons. More information about interpreting UAC forecasts can be found on their [Forecast Tutorial page](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/forecast/tutorial).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

These data represent the [Utah Avalanche Center](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/) (UAC) Forecast Zone boundaries within the state of Utah. The UAC issues forecasts, watches, warnings, bulletins, and information about mountain and weather conditions for these zones.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

UAC uses these zones to issue avalanche forecasts for areas in Utah. This dataset serves as a resource for recreational planning and use by organizations that benefit from avalanche forecasts. It is suitable for cartographic and general analytic purposes. Current forecast data can be pulled from UAC's [API](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/docs/api/forecast) or [website](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/) and joined to this polygon layer for symbolizing in maps or web applications.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon feature in this dataset represents the approximate geographic boundaries of a UAC forecast zone. Features in this dataset include attributes such as the name, center issuing the forecast, forecast link, and forecast key.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset from a geojson layer provided by the [Utah Avalanche Center API](https://api.avalanche.org/v2/public/products/map-layer/UAC). We projected the data into UTM Zone 12N and simplified the data schema.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is consistent with current Utah Avalanche Center forecast zone boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
