## Brief Summary

Points dataset of trailheads that provide access to private and public trails in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset depicts point locations of more than 500 trailheads in Utah. This dataset includes a wide variety of public and private trails, including hiking, mountain biking, and OHV trails.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Utah Trailheads contains locations that serve as access points for off-road recreational trails that are primarily used by hikers, pedestrians, and mountain bikers. This dataset contains trailhead points only; for trail polylines, please see the [Utah Trails and Pathways](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/recreation/trails-pathways/) dataset available from the SGID.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset serves as a resource for recreational and city planning, hiking and mountain biking search engines, and local government authorities. It is suitable for cartographic and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the approximate location of a trailhead, which may include structures such as parking lots, visitor centers, or historical monuments. Features in this dataset include the trail name, type, and data source for the point. You can learn more about the model used to develop this layer through [UGRC documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OPGKmRrLYUBr9qO9EtbX6AwcRla82xMvc-BDr26ia9k/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using map data purchased from Orbital View by the GOED Office of Outdoor Recreation in 2017. Additional trails can be [submitted](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) to UGRC for inclusion in this map layer.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is still a work-in-process and does not represent all trailheads available in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
