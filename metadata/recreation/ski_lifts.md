## Brief Summary

## Summary

Surface and aerial ski transportation lifts within Utah’s alpine ski areas and resorts. Lifts include lifts, trams, gondolas, and permanent rope tows and are represented as lines for Utah’s alpine ski areas: Alta, Beaver Mountain, Brian Head, Brighton, Cherry Peak, Deer Valley, Eagle Point, Park City, Powder Mountain, Snowbasin, Snowbird, Solitude, Sundance and Wolf Mountain. The ski lifts were digitized from high resolution aerial photography by AGRC staff. They are for general cartographic or location purposes. Each feature carries the name of lift, the ski area/resort that operates it, skier capacity, base and top elevations, type of lift, and county. This dataset reflects current lifts for the 2017-18 season. AGRC updates this dataset annually, as needed.

Display ski lifts, trams, gondolas, and rope tows for all of Utah ski resorts for general cartographic purposes. This dataset is maintained annually by Utah AGRC staff, with updates typically in the late Fall.
