The resorts included in this dataset are Alta, Beaver Mountain, Brian Head, Brighton, Cherry Peak, Deer Valley, Eagle Point, Nordic Valley, Park City, Powder Mountain, Snowbasin, Snowbird, Solitude, and Sundance. The boundaries are simplified for general cartographic or location purposes and do not depict exact areas of operation, avalanche control, or ownership.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature carries the name of the ski area and a ‘four color’ attribute for symbolization.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by digitizing points on top of high resolution aerial photography and terrain models. These boundaries are current as of 2016-2017 season.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

These data are approximate boundaries for general reference or cartographic purposes and do not accurately reflect areas of operation, avalanche control, or land ownership/leases. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns regarding this dataset.
