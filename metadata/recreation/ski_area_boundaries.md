### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Polygons in this dataset represent approximate geographical boundaries for ski resorts in Utah. Each feature includes the name of the ski area and a field for symbolization (COLOR4).

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by digitizing points on top of high resolution aerial photography and terrain models. We maintain this dataset and update it as needed.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

These data are approximate boundaries for general reference purposes and do not accurately reflect areas of operation, avalanche control, or land ownership/leases. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns regarding this dataset.
