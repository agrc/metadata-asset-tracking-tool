## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

These data are approximate boundaries for general reference or cartographic purposes and do not accurately reflect areas of operation, avalanche control, or land ownership/leases.

Polygon boundaries for Utah’s alpine ski areas and resorts for planning and other general purposes. Created by staff of Utah AGRC.

The boundaries of Utah’s alpine ski areas and resorts are represented as polygons for Alta, Beaver Mountain, Brian Head, Brighton, Cherry Peak, Deer Valley, Eagle Point, Park City, Powder Mountain, Snowbasin, Snowbird, Solitude, Sundance and Wolf Mountain. The boundaries are simplified for general cartographic or location purposes and do not depict exact areas of operation, avalanche control, or ownership. Each feature carries the name of the ski area and a ‘four color’ attribute for symbolization. This dataset reflects current boundaries for the 2016-17 season and was created by digitizing boundaries using physical features from terrain models and from high resolution aerial photography.
