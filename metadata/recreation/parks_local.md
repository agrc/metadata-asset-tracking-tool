## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of local community parks.

## Summary

This dataset contains local neighborhood open spaces such as community parks, soccer fields and equestrian areas. This dataset does not include state or national parks, privately owned parks, or stadiums.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains outdoor community spaces such as parks and soccer fields represented as polygons.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon represents the approximate geographic extent of a given park and contains attributes such as the name of the park, type (neighborhood park, soccer field, equestrian, etc.), and area in acres.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset in collaboration with county government partners. County officials sent us a list of parks and public spaces to be included, then we digitized these places as polygons on top of [NAIP imagery](https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com/) and utilized higher resolution resources as they became available. This dataset is updated as counties submit new parks to be included or existing parks to be removed.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete resource for local and community parks in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns regarding this dataset.
