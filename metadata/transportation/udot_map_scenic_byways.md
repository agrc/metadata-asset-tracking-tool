## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of state and national scenic byways found in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polyline features representing national and state byways found in Utah. This layer contains designated scenic roads only, for a comprehensive roads dataset, please see the [Utah Roads](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/road-centerlines/) layer available in the [Transportation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/) on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Scenic byways are roads that possess cultural, recreational, natural, or historic qualities that have been registered with either the [Utah Department of Transportation](https://digitaldelivery.udot.utah.gov/datasets/uplan::utah-scenic-byways/about) (for state scenic byways) or the [Federal Highway Administration](https://fhwaapps.fhwa.dot.gov/bywaysp) (for nationally designated byways). This dataset contains both state and national scenic byways. You can learn more about Utah's scenic byways through the [official travel guide](https://travel.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/UOT17-Scenic-Byway-Guide.pdf).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference, planning, and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polyline in this dataset has been placed down the center of the road. Features in this dataset include the byway name, date the road was adopted as an official scenic byway, and road leader.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created using data from the Utah Department of Transportation. This layer was created for display at scale 1:126720.

<!--- Our dataset looks pretty similar to the one UDOT has on their website, just slightly different schema. Is there anything in particular differentiating our dataset from theirs? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete geospatial resource for scenic byways in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
