## Brief Summary

Utah Roads is a multi-purpose statewide roads dataset for cartography, routing, and range-based address location.

## Summary

Utah Roads is a multi-purpose statewide roads dataset for cartography, routing, and range-based address location. This dataset is also used as the base geometry for deriving the geospatial representation of UDOT's advanced highway linear referencing system ([ALRS](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/highway-routes-lrs/)) as well as [UGRC's network analysis datasets](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes information such as road name, type, speed limit, and infrastructure. To see specifics about the data model including field names, field descriptions, data types and coded value domains, see the [data model spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546) and the corresponding tabs for update notes. The color-coded section titled "Addressing" is primarily maintained by local stewards, whereas the section titled "DOT/FHWA" is primarily maintained by UDOT. UGRC spatially assigns fields in the section titled "Placename/Area", based on current SGID polygon boundaries.

Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The Utah Roads layer plays an important role in [active transportation](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/) planning in Utah. For example, recent collaborative efforts between UGRC, [UDOT](https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/,) and [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) have led to significant enhancements in the bike and pedestrian data not only on this roads layer, but also on the trails and pathways layers. You can contribute to the on-street bike data by [letting us know](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) where we have gaps or inaccurate information.

As part of UGRC's ongoing efforts to standardize schema and improve data shareability, this model has been designed to suggest 'best practices' for stewards. We encourage stewards to use this model to estimate how well a given dataset 'translates' to this schema and [Next Generation 911 preparedness](https://www.911.gov/issues/ng911/).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset contains over 400,000 polyline features representing more than 50,000 roads in Utah. Each polyline represents the centerline of the road and indicates its cardinal direction. Divided highways such as I-15 include both a positive and negative direction segment.

### How was the dataset created?

The Utah Roads dataset utilizes a data model based on Next-Generation 911 (NG911) standards and the Federal Highway Administration's ([ARNOLD](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/data-analysis-tools/rsdp/rsdp-tools/arnold-reference-manual)) reporting requirements for state DOTs. UGRC adopted this data model on September 13, 2017. This statewide roads dataset is maintained by UGRC in partnership with local government, UDOT, and NG911 officials.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This is the most accurate representation of statewide roads and highways. While this dataset does contain USFS roads, please visit the [FSGeodata Clearinghouse](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=transportation) for the most current and complete datasets for USFS roads.
