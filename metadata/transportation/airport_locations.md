## Summary

Utah Airport Locations is a subset of the Federal Aviation Administration's National Airspace System Aeronautical Data products. This dataset only includes airports and heliports found in Utah.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations of aircraft landing facilities in the state of Utah, including commercial airports, hospital heliports, and other facilities. This dataset includes attribute data on the physical and operational characteristics of each facility.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

<!--- Is this dataset used in airport information lookups or anything else like that? Does it serve a more specific purpose? --->

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point on this dataset represents the location of an airport or heliport in Utah. Points were placed on or near the main structure of the airport. The lan_fa_ty field indicates the type of landing facility. Other attributes in this dataset include [enplanement](https://www.faa.gov/airports/planning_capacity/passenger_allcargo_stats/passenger) numbers, usage statistics, and a unique facility ID number (locid).

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC derived this dataset from the National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data Product available from the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/). We extracted and refined the data to provide a more focused dataset for Utah-based users.

<!--- The original metadata refers to this "National Airspace System Resource Aeronautical Data Product", but I'm not sure that's the actual name of the database where this dataset came from, as I couldn't find it anywhere. They have a data download page of aeronautical data products, but none by this name specifically. Do we know where this dataset was derived from? --->

<!--- Also, do we know how often this dataset is updated/who maintains it? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete resource for airport location data in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
