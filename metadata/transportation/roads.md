## Brief Summary

Utah Roads is a multi-purpose statewide roads dataset for cartography, routing, and range-based address location.

## Summary

Utah Roads is a comprehensive statewide roads dataset for mapping, addressing, and route planning. This data follows national standards for [NENA NG911](https://www.nena.org/page/standards) and [USDOT ARNOLD](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/data-analysis-tools/rsdp/rsdp-tools/arnold-reference-manual) and is updated monthly for urban counties, with other counties updated throughout the year. UGRC collaborates with various agencies to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes information such as road name, type, speed limit, and infrastructure. To see specifics about the data model including field names, field descriptions, data types and coded value domains, see the [data model spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546) and the corresponding tabs for update notes. The color-coded section titled "Addressing" is primarily maintained by local stewards, whereas the section titled "DOT/FHWA" is primarily maintained by UDOT. UGRC spatially assigns fields in the section titled "Placename/Area", based on current SGID polygon boundaries.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The Utah Roads dataset aggregates all road information from various cities, agencies, and counties into a single, multi-purpose dataset. Additionally, it plays an important role in [active transportation](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/) planning in Utah. For example, recent collaborative efforts between UGRC, [UDOT](https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/,) and [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) have led to significant enhancements in the bike and pedestrian data. These enhancements can be seen not only on this roads layer, but also on the [trails and pathways layers](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/recreation/trails-pathways/). You can contribute to the on-street bike data by [letting us know](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) where we have gaps or inaccurate information.

As part of UGRC's ongoing efforts to standardize schema and improve data shareability, the Utah Roads data model has been designed to suggest best practices for stewards. We encourage stewards to use this model to estimate how well their datasets align with this schema in preparation for [Next Generation 911](https://www.911.gov/issues/ng911/).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset contains polyline features representing more than 50,000 roads in Utah. Each polyline represents the centerline of the road and indicates its cardinal direction. Divided highways include centerline features for both directions. For example, I-15 include separate features for the northbound and southbound segments.

### How was the dataset created?

The Utah Roads dataset utilizes a data model based on Next-Generation 911 (NG911) standards and the [Federal Highway Administration's](https://highways.dot.gov/) ARNOLD reporting requirements for state DOTs. UGRC adopted this data model on September 13, 2017. UGRC aggregates updated road information from county authorities and UDOT into this dataset on a monthly basis.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This is the most authoritative representation of statewide roads and highways in Utah. While this dataset does contain USFS roads, please visit the [FSGeodata Clearinghouse](https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/datasets.php?dsetCategory=transportation) for the most current and complete datasets for USFS roads. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with other questions concerning this dataset.
