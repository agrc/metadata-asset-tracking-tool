## Brief Summary

Points dataset of railroad mileposts used for emergency services dispatch and other analysis.

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations for railroad mileposts found along Utah's main railroads. For railroad polylines, please see the [Utah Railroads](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/railroads/) dataset available in the [Transportation Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/) from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset is a linear reference system containing points that indicate both the locations of real-world physical markers and digital points calculated at even intervals. These points make up a network of mainline railroads in Utah that are used for emergency services dispatch and general analysis.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to improve emergency dispatch services in Utah. These data are used to provide an alternate means of describing a particular location along a railroad, which helps first responders know precisely where an incident has occurred.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset indicates the mile post location, mile post number (rr_milepos), coordinates, and railroad division that owns the milepost.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by calculating distances along the Utah Railroads polylines and placing points at regular intervals along those lines. We supplemented these data with railroad mileposts provided by the [Federal Railroad Administration](https://railroads.dot.gov/) to produce this final dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the most current and complete version of railroad mileposts available in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
