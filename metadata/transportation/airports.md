## Summary

This dataset contains outlines for airport facilities, landing strips, and other types of aircraft facilities. International, regional, municipal, and remoter airports are represented in this dataset.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polylines representing runways and airport outlines found in Utah. Line features may include the landing strip, airport facilities, and other adjacent buildings.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature in this dataset indicates the perimeter of an airport or landing facility, including runways, landing areas, and adjacent structures. Features in this dataset include the name, facility type (fac_type), unique facility ID number (loc_id), county, city, owner type, and elevation.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC derived this dataset using data products available from the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/). We extracted and refined the data to provide a more focused dataset for Utah-based users. We update this dataset as new information becomes available.

<!--- This is under the assumption that this dataset was made in a similar fashion to the airport locations points dataset. is that the case? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents approximate outlines for airports and runways only. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
