## Brief Summary

Dataset containing parcel boundary, parcel identifier, parcel address, owner type, and county recorder contact information.

## Summary

These datasets contain information such as parcel boundary, parcel identifier, parcel address, and owner type. Individual parcels are represented as polygons and are provided to UGRC by each county.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Basic Parcels datasets contain information such as the county name, parcel address, and land owner type. Each county supplies its own data to UGRC, thus, users should expect some variation in schema and completeness between counties.

Parcel polygons contain attributes unique to each parcel such as a unique parcel number (PARCEL_ID), address for the parcel (PARCEL_ADD, PARCEL_CITY, PARCEL_ZIP), update information (ParcelsCur, ParcelsRec, ParcelsPub, ParcelYear, ParcelNotes), a generalized land ownership designation (OWN_TYPE), and the phone number for the county recorders office (RECORDER).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset represents UGRC's ongoing effort to compile statewide parcels following the passage of [HB113](https://le.utah.gov/~2005/bills/hbillenr/HB0113.htm) in 2005. Parcel data is used in a variety of contexts, including public safety, economic development, transportation, planning, and the provision of public services.

### What does the dataset represent?

A parcel is a defined area of land that is owned by a public or private entity. Parcels are represented as polygons. A general guide to the field definitions and values is available in the Utah Parcels [schema summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qCRpGJGcHkKfvsm3M3uUGfTyBOUw8WmYCWRPEDI49xs/edit?usp=sharing).

### How was the dataset created?

<!--- When talking about how the dataset was made, the original metadata talks about the "LIR Working Group", which I presume was the primary force behind the LIR parcels, but was that group also responsible for these basic parcels? Is the history of both datasets about the same? -->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Both the Basic Parcel and the LIR Parcel layers are designed for general purpose uses, and are not substitutes for researching and obtaining the most current, legal land records information on file in County records. The [Cadastre Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/) proposes a schedule, general guideline, and process for assembling county parcel and assessment data into an annual, statewide tax parcel GIS layer.
