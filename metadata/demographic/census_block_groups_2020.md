Census 2020 Block Groups

## ID

7bdd5e18-6eba-4e7e-b578-2168bde71090

## Brief Summary

The second-smallest geographic unit with very basic demographic data.

## Summary

Census Block Groups are aggregations of multiple [Census blocks](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/census-2020-block-groups/). Similar to [other Census datasets](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/) available on the SGID, only a very limited amount of demographic information is available to preserve privacy.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

2020 Census Block Groups are units used by the United States Census Bureau which are geographically larger than the Census block and smaller than the [Census tract](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/census-2020-tracts/). It is the smallest geographical unit for which the Census Bureau publishes sample data. Block groups generally have a total population of 600 to 3,000 people.

in the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number.

A common Census aggregation level with widely available information.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

and are used to present data and control block numbering

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

### How was the dataset created?

Utah's 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration with the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureauâ€™s Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate in PSAP, and a regional organization or the State Data Center was not available to participate. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within the census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross state, county, or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of any other geographic entity.

All legal boundaries used for the 2020 Census are those reported to the Census Bureau to be in effect as of January 1, 2020.

The legal boundaries are collected through various surveys and programs: the Boundary and Annexation Survey, Redistricting Data Program, and the School District Review Program.
