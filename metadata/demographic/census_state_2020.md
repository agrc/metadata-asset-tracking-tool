## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Utah's official state boundary for the 2020 Census.

## Summary

This layer contains Utah's official state boundary for the 2020 Census. It contains boundary information only and doesn't include demographic data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes the boundary geometry for the Utah state boundary as used by the US Census Bureau. This layer is not updated as adjustments to the Utah State Boundary are made; for an updated version of this boundary, please see the [Utah State Boundary](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/utah-state/) layer available on the SGID.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is intended to be used in Census-based studies and general analytic purposes. Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

The polygon feature in this dataset indicates the Utah state boundary as of January 1, 2020.

### How was the dataset created?

Utah's 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration from the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create user-friendly, ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The data available on this page was downloaded from the [2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2). All 2020 census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the [census redistricting data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
