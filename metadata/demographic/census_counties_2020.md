## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of county boundaries in Utah as of the 2020 Census.

## Summary

Polygon dataset of county boundaries in Utah as derived from the US Census Bureau. County boundaries are as of January 1, 2020 and do not contain demographic data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset represents each county in Utah as a polygon that contains basic attributes such as the county name and a unique county number.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset is the official representation of counties as of the 2020 Census. It is ideal for Census-based analyses by local governments, private entities, and other interested parties.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, rather, it contains a set of boundaries used for general purposes that conforms to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two counties areas may cover the same geographic extent).

### How was the dataset created?

Utah's 2020 Census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration with the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents county boundaries in Utah as of January 1, 2020. Is is not updated as county boundaries are updated. For current county boundaries as certified through the Lieutenant Governor's Office, please see the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) dataset.
