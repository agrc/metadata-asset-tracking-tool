## Description

### What is the dataset?

The US Census Bureau defines tracts as "small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county." Census Tracts are the most common geographic unit used for demographic analyses and generally have between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an average population of 4,000. These units are designed to be relatively permanent for statistical purposes.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Census Tracts are used in a variety of statistical analyses. Due to their semi-permanent nature, tracts are a useful means of comparing demographic changes over time.

### What does the dataset represent?

The geographic extent of Census Tracts are represented as polygons with attributes such as the population as of the 2020 Census and unique identifiers for the tract.

### How was the dataset created?

Utah's 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration with the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

All 2020 census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the US Census Bureau [Redistricting Data Page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
