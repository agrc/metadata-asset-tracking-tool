## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Census blocks in populated areas as determined by aerial imagery.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygon boundaries for 2010 Census blocks covering populated areas in Utah, as determined by 2015 aerial imagery and address point coverage. For 2020 Census data products, please see the [Demographic Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Census blocks are small geographic zones through which population data can be collected and organized. These blocks are often bounded by features such as roads, rivers, or property lines. This dataset includes Census blocks in populated areas of Utah as of the 2010 Census.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographic extent of a census block in a populated area. Features in this dataset include the approximate population and number of households as of the 2010 Census.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using the original 2010 Census Blocks from the US Census Bureau. We clipped these blocks to only cover residential and developed areas as shown in aerial imagery and/or containing address points. This dataset was updated in 2015 using new aerial photography and the latest address point locations at that time.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Populated areas shown in this dataset are approximate only. This layer is for historical reference and does not reflect current population numbers or Census block boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
