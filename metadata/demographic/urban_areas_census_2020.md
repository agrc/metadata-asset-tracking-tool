## ID

8d75fea5-645a-44ae-b066-1d231dab3399

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas designated as residential, commercial, or other urban land uses.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing urban areas as defined by the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/) during the 2020 Census. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not include demographic data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The US Census Bureau [defines urban areas](https://ask.census.gov/prweb/PRServletCustom/app/ECORRAsk/YACFBFye-rFIz_FoGtyvDRUGg1Uzu5Mn*/!STANDARD?pzuiactionrrr=CXtpbn0rTEpMcGRYOG1vS0tqTFAwaENUZWpvM1NNWEMzZ3p5aFpnWUxzVmw0TjJnbzhGN1llanJKR0NmVHVDNmxQY201*) as "densely developed territory, and encompass residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. Each urban area must encompass at least 2000 housing units or at least 5000 people."

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general cartographic and analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of an urban area as defined by the US Census Bureau. Features in this dataset contain the area name, population, and number of housing units as of the 2020 Census.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset from a subset of nationally available Census data. The US Census Bureau defined urban areas using the population and housing unit density from Census blocks. In the past, the Census has delineated between "urbanized areas" and "urban clusters", but as of the 2020 Census, these definitions have been combined to encompass the urban areas found in this dataset.

UGRC, in collaboration with the [Wasatch Front Regional Council](https://wfrc.org/), have also created tabular datasets for demographic data that can be joined to this dataset for enhanced functionality. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

All 2020 Census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the US Census Bureau [Redistricting Data Page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
