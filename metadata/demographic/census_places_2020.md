## Brief Summary

Incorporated towns and Census Designated Places (CDPs) in Utah from the 2020 Census.

## Summary

Census Places consist of both legally incorporated cities and Census Designated Places (CDPs). This dataset contains boundary information only and does not include demographic data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygon boundaries for cities, towns, and Census Designated Places (CDPs) in Utah. The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bas/information/cdp.html) defines CDPs as "statistical geography representing closely settled, unincorporated communities that are locally recognized and identified by name." Both these unincorporated communities and legally incorporated municipalities are represented in this dataset.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The US Census Bureau uses both legally incorporated places (cities, towns, etc) and unincorporated places (CDPs) for the Census. While this dataset does not contain demographic information, it can be joined to other layers to visualize population and housing data. You can read more about how GIS is used in other areas of the Census on the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

The geographic extents of Incorporated cities and CDPs are represented as polygons and can be distinguished by the CLASSFP20 field using the following coded values:

- U1 = a CDP with a federally recognized name
- U2 = a CDP without an officially recognized name
- C1 = an active, incorporated place
- M2 = a military or defense installation entirely within a place

You can find more information about these codes on the US Census Bureau's [website](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/class-codes.html).

### How was the dataset created?

Utah's 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration with the Analytics Group at the Wasatch Front Regional Council [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/), used that August 12 release to create ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. These new datasets include more user-friendly field names for shapefile users and field aliasing for geodatabase users. WFRC and UGRC have also created tabular datasets for demographic data that can be joined to this dataset for enhanced functionality. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset includes all CDPs and incorporated cities and towns as of January 1, 2020. Boundary adjustments to cities and towns since then are not represented in this dataset. For current incorporated city and towns in Utah, please see our [Municipal Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/municipal/) dataset. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the US Census Bureau [Redistricting Data Page](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
