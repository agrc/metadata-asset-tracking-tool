## Brief Summary

Incorporated towns and Census Designated Places (CDPs) in Utah from the 2020 Census.

## Summary

Census Places consist of both legally-established cities and Census Designated Places (CDPs). CDPs provide data for unincorporated but concentrated areas of development that are readily identifiable by name but aren't officially incorporated as a city. This layer only contains boundary information to enable you to join your own demographic data.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

In Utah, “places” include cities, towns, metro townships, and census-designated places (CDPs). The first three are legal boundaries in Utah, representing incorporated places that provide governmental functions for a concentration of people. CDPs are statistical boundaries delineated by the Census Bureau. They provide data for recognizable places that are not legally incorporated.
 
The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bas/information/cdp.html) defines Census Designated Places as "CDPs are a statistical geography representing closely settled, unincorporated communities that are locally recognized and identified by name."

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

Incorporated cities and CDPs can be distinguished by the CLASSFP20 field.

### How was the dataset created?

Utah's 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration with the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The data available on this page was downloaded from the [2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2). All 2020 census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the [census redistricting data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
