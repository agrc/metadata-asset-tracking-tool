## Brief Summary

Incorporated towns and Census Designated Places (CDPs) in Utah from the 2020 Census.

## Summary

Census Places consist of both legally-established cities and Census Designated Places (CDPs). CDPs provide data for unincorporated but concentrated areas of development at are readily identifiable by name but aren't officially incorporated as a city. This layer only contains boundary information to enable you to join your own demographic data.

Incorporated cities and CDPs can be distinguished by the CLASSFP20 field.

## Description

Utah's 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau will release a more user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. In the meantime, UGRC, with collaboration from the Analytics Group at WFRC, has worked with the August 12 release and has created ready-to-use GIS data in several formats that hopefully make the 2020 redistricting data easier to use. Read more about these offerings in the blog post, 2020 Census Redistricting Data in Easy to Use GIS Formats

The 2020 data available on this page was downloaded from the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171). All 2020 census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the census redistricting data.

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. Read about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 census geography blog and fact sheet.

In Utah, “places” include cities, towns, metro townships, and census-designated places (CDPs). The first three are legal boundaries in Utah, representing incorporated places that provide governmental functions for a concentration of people. CDPs are statistical boundaries delineated by the Census Bureau. They provide data for recognizable places that are not legally incorporated.

### What is the dataset?

The [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/bas/information/cdp.html) defines Census Designated Places as "CDPs are a statistical geography representing closely settled, unincorporated communities that are locally recognized and identified by name."
