Polygon dataset of unpopulated areas in Utah dissolved as a single feature.

## Summary

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset is a representation of Utah areas that have little to no population, buildings, or addresses, dissolved into a single polygon.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to represent the portion of Utah with little to no permanent population.  Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset displays areas that contain little or no residential districts or developed areas as a single polygon feature. This dataset does not contain demographic data.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using parts of the original 2010 Census data from the US Census Bureau. Populated census blocks and a buffer around known addresses were used erase populated areas within the state, thus leaving behind the unpopulated areas in this dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Unpopulated areas shown in this dataset are approximate only. This layer is for historical reference and does not reflect current population numbers or Census data. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
