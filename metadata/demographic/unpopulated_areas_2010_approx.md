## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of unpopulated areas in Utah dissolved as a single feature.

## Summary

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Census blocks are small geographic zones through which population data can be collected and organized. These blocks are often bounded by features such as roads, rivers, or property lines. This dataset includes Census blocks in unpopulated areas of Utah as of the 2010 Census that have been dissolved into a single polygon.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset displays areas that contain little or no residential districts or developed areas as a single polygon feature. This dataset does not contain demographic data.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using the original 2010 Census Blocks from the US Census Bureau. We used aerial imagery to determine unpopulated areas of Utah. This dataset was updated in 2015 using new aerial photography and address point locations.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Unpopulated areas shown in this dataset are approximate only. This layer is for historical reference and does not reflect current population numbers or Census block boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
