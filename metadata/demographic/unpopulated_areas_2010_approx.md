## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset is a representation of Utah areas that have little to no population, buildings, or addresses, dissolved into a single polygon.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

The polygon feature in this dataset indicates areas that contain little or no residential districts or developed areas. This dataset does not contain demographic data or other attributes.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using parts of the original 2010 Census data from the US Census Bureau. We used populated Census blocks and a buffer around known addresses to erase populated areas within the state, thus leaving behind the unpopulated areas in this dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Unpopulated areas shown in this dataset are approximate only. This layer is for historical reference and does not reflect current population numbers or Census data. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
