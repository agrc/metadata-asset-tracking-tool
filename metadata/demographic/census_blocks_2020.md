## ID

## Brief Summary

Basic demographic data in the smallest geographic unit used by the US Census Bureau.

## Summary

Census Blocks are the smallest geographic unit used by the United States Census Bureau for tabulating population information. Due to privacy concerns, only a limited amount of data is available at the block level.

## Description

### What is the dataset

Census blocks are small geographic zones through which population data can be collected and organized. These blocks are often bounded by features such as roads, rivers, or property lines. This dataset includes the census blocks for the State of Utah represented as polygons.

### What is the purpose of the dataset

Geography is a fundamental aspect of the Census, providing the framework for the once-a-decade count of population and housing. You can read more about some of the key geography changes in the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute's 2020 Census Geography [Blog](https://gardner.utah.edu/blog/blog-whats-new-in-utahs-census-2020-geography/) and [fact sheet](https://d36oiwf74r1rap.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/Geog-FS-Mar2021.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent

Each Census block in this dataset includes a unique four-digit Census Block Number. For more information on how to interpret the Census Block Number, refer to [this article](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2011/07/what-are-census-blocks.html) from the US Census Bureau. While Census blocks include information on major racial groups, housing, and population, it is important to note that Census blocks are delineated by physical and municipal boundaries, not by population size. Thus, a larger block does not denote a larger population size. In fact, many Census blocks contain a population number of zero (such as in the case of water-only areas).

### How was the dataset created

Utah's 2020 Census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021 and the demographic redistricting legacy files (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files) became available on August 12, 2021. The Census Bureau released a user-friendly version of the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary Files on September 30, 2021. UGRC, in collaboration from the Analytics Group at [WFRC](https://wfrc.org/) used that August 12 release to create user-friendly, ready-to-use GIS data in several formats. You can learn more about these offerings on [our website](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2021-08-31-census-2020-redistricting-data/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset

The data available on this page was downloaded from the [2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2). All 2020 Census geographies reflect boundaries as of January 1, 2020. Additional GIS files and support products are available on the [census redistricting data](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/rdo/summary-files.html#P2).
