Utah GNIS Place Names

## ID

bb1f7501-fdfa-451a-8333-44219355c2cb

## Brief Summary

Points dataset of geographic features from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).

## Summary

This dataset contains a wide variety of point locations from the USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). Each point contains the feature name, type, quadrangle, and latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations of both naturally-occurring and manmade physical and cultural features in Utah. Natural features may include valleys, mountains, and ridges, whereas artifical features may include cities, post offices, and mining districts. Each point includes the standardized name for that feature from the [Geographic Names Information System](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis) (GNIS) maintained by the United States Geologic Survey.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

USGS developed the GNIS in an effort to create a central, national database of standardized geographic names. UGRC created this dataset to provide Utah-based users with a more focused and simplified resource on GNIS place names in their state.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset represents the approximate location of a given feature and includes its GNIS name, average elevation, and coordinates. Features are further categorized by feature type (Valley, Summit, Stream, Civil, etc.) and by the USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle they are located in (quad_name).

<!--- Do we know how they decide where to put the points? Many of the points are elongated features such as rivers or streams; how do they choose where to put a singular point for that feature? --->

### How was the dataset created?

The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN), local governments and other interested organizations.

<!--- Do we maintain this dataset? Is it maintained at all? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of GNIS named features in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
