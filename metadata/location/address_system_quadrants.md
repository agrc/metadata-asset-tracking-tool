Utah Address System Quadrants

## ID

ae2b0c31-a204-462d-a799-971f43df6eca

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset containing the extent of each addressing grid, and its four quadrants (NE, NW, SE, SW), which define how address numbers are assigned in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygon boundaries for address system quadrants in Utah. [Address points](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/address-points/), [ZIP code areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/zip-codes/), and other data involved with defining addresses in Utah can be found in the [Location Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Address systems define which numbers are assigned to physical addresses for homes, buildings, roads, and other structures. Utah divides its address system into quadrants, each with a central origin with street numbers increasing outwards from that point. Quadrants are further divided along a north-south axis and an east-west axis. These quadrants determine how streets are numbered for all the addresses found within the polygon boundary.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

UGRC maintains a statewide dataset of address system quadrants primarily to improve address geocoding with the [UGRC API](https://api.mapserv.utah.gov/docs/). When geocoding an address, the input place name or ZIP code is replaced with the address system to provide the highest match rates. You can learn more about the history of addressing systems and how they are used today on our blog in the post [The Western Grid, Explained](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2019-03-11-the-western-grid/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographical area of a given address system quadrant. Features in this dataset include the grid name, quadrant cardinal direction, and county.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using data submitted by local government partners.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of address system quadrants available in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
