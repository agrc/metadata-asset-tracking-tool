## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of address system quadrants used for geocoding physical addresses in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygon boundaries for address system quadrants in Utah. [Address points](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/address-points/), [ZIP code areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/zip-codes/), and other data involved with defining addresses in Utah can be found in the [Location Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/) available on the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Address systems define which numbers are assigned to physical addresses for homes, buildings, roads, and other structures. Utah divides its address system into quadrants, each with a central origin with street numbers increasing outwards from that point. Quadrants are further divided along a north-south axis and an east-west axis. These quadrants determine how streets are numbered for all the addresses found within the polygon boundary.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Address system quadrants are primarily used to geocode addresses and serves as one of the many layers involved with [UGRC's geocoding API](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2013-04-02-using-the-mapserv-utah-gov-api-to-geocode-address/). You can learn more about the history of addressing systems and how they are used today on [our blog](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2013-04-02-using-the-mapserv-utah-gov-api-to-geocode-address/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographical area of a given address system quadrant. Features in this dataset include the grid name, quadrant cardinal direction, and county.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using data submitted by local government partners.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete version of address system quadrants available in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
