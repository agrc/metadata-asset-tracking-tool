# Title

Utah Address Points

## ID

4373453d-9e20-44da-9c6e-1f0b1ea653af

## Brief Summary

Contains US Postal Service address points for all twenty-nine counties in Utah.

## Summary

An address point represents a geographic location that has been assigned a US Postal Service (USPS) address by the local address authority (i.e., county or municipality) but does not necessarily receive mail.

## Description

### What is the dataset

This dataset contains vector point data for over one million addresses in the State of Utah.

<!---
This is a very short description,and admittedly, I had some difficulty coming up with what to add to it that didn't stray into "what is the purpose of this dataset" or "how was this dataset created" categories. I will keep thinking on it though, and I am open to suggestions on what else to describe the nature of the data.

### What is the purpose of the dataset

The Address Points GIS data are used for [geocoding](api.mapserv.utah.gov), city planning, and [redistricting](https://redistricting.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Redistricting-Packet-1-compressed.pdf).

### What does the dataset represent

The address points in this dataset include information such as:

- Full street address (i.e., the USPS mailing address, if the address is for a physical location [rather than a PO box])
- Whether the location is a building
- The type of unit
- The city and ZIP code
- Unique code identifiers, including the Federal Information Processing Standard ([FIPS](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips)) county code and the US National Grid ([USNG](https://www.fgdc.gov/usng/how-to-read-usng)) spatial address
- The date that the address point was added to the dataset

### How was the dataset created

The information in the Address Points dataset was originally compiled by Utah counties and municipalities and was aggregated by UGRC for the Master Address List ([MAL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIHEnmJ1dRekSd6n0s_oiS-Xy84JOaWUEqXXTnKsF1U/edit#gid=0)) grant initiative in 2012. The purpose of this initiative was to ensure that all state entities were using the same verified, accurate county and municipal address information.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset

This dataset is a mapping-grade framework layer that receives regular updates. As with all our datasets, UGRC works to ensure the quality and accuracy of our data to the best of our abilities.

<!---
Is "we do our best" good enough an answer for how reliable and accurate something is? This was included in the original text for the metadata, but I find it to be something of a non-answer. I'm our layers undergo rigorous accuracy checks, but how much of that do we want to include here? Should we say "we do our best" for brevity's sake?

## Updates

### Update Schedule

Maintaining this dataset is an ongoing effort between UGRC, counties, and local municipalities. UGRC works with each county or municipality's MAL authority to continually improve the address point data. Counties have been placed on an update schedule depending on numerous factors, including rates of development and population growth. Densely populated counties, such as Salt Lake, Utah, and Weber, are updated monthly, while less populous counties may be updated quarterly or semi-annually.

### Previous Updates

<!---
This is another way of displaying previous updates. I like the way it looks, however, I recognize that this sort of metadata would need to be updated regularly, and that might not be the most efficient if we had to update this paragraph every time an update was performed on the address points layer.
