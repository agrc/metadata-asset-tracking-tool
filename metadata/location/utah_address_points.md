Utah Address Points

## ID

4373453d-9e20-44da-9c6e-1f0b1ea653af

## Brief Summary

Contains US Postal Service address points for all twenty-nine counties in Utah.

## Summary

An address point represents a geographic location that has been assigned a US Postal Service (USPS) address by the local addressing authority (i.e., county or municipality) but does not necessarily receive mail.

## Description

### What is the dataset

This dataset contains vector point data for over one million addresses in the State of Utah and includes information such as the full street address and the type of unit the point represents. This dataset is a mapping-grade framework layer that receives regular updates. Maintaining this dataset is an ongoing effort between UGRC and county-level data stewards.

### What is the purpose of the dataset

Address data are used for a variety of purposes, including [geocoding](api.mapserv.utah.gov), city planning, and [redistricting](https://redistricting.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Redistricting-Packet-1-compressed.pdf). In addition, UGRC actively collaborates with the US Postal Service and Google Maps to improve mail and package delivery, navigation apps, and emergency services.

This dataset has also been used by the [Utah Broadband Center](https://business.utah.gov/broadband/) and UGRC to determine areas with limited internet access in an effort to improve services in underserved communities.

### What does the dataset represent

Points are generally placed on the structure associated with the address, but may also be found on the driveway or otherwise within the parcel of land. In cases where the county has provided the specific location of the address point for a given address, it is denoted in the "PtLocation" field. The address points also include information such as:

- The type of unit
- Whether the location is a building
- The city and ZIP code
- Unique code identifiers, including the Federal Information Processing Standard ([FIPS](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips)) county code and the US National Grid ([USNG](https://www.fgdc.gov/usng/how-to-read-usng)) spatial address
- The date that the address point was added to the dataset

### How was the dataset created

The information in the Address Points dataset was originally compiled by Utah counties and was aggregated by UGRC for the Master Address List (MAL) grant initiative in 2012. The purpose of this initiative was to ensure that all state entities were using the same verified, accurate county and municipal address information.

Updated address points are received from county MAL authorities and aggregated by UGRC to produce the latest version of the Address Points dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset

As with all our datasets, UGRC works to ensure the quality and accuracy of our data. Questions about specific counties and their address points can be directed to the [county addressing authorities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MIHEnmJ1dRekSd6n0s_oiS-Xy84JOaWUEqXXTnKsF1U/edit#gid=0).
