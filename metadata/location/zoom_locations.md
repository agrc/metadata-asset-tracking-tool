## Description

The dataset was created by AGRC staff using the best available data in Utah's State Geographic Information Database (SGID), January 31, 2011 to support the 'magic zoom' map search functionality contained in the middle (map) panel of the Utah Broadband Interactive map (http://mapserv.utah.gov/broadband)

This dataset contains the boundaries for utah counties, cities, regional government, zipcodes, tribal lands, national forests, national parks, national monuments, state parks, legislative and congressional districts and buffered polygons for placenames, junctions, and other features shown on the UDOT Highway Map.

This data contains polygons of commonly used places in mapping. It was created by UGRC from multiple sources including the GNIS point, municipalities, counties, political districts, ZIP codes, etc. The dataset is named ZoomLocations since the names and geometries can be used to zoom to common areas on a map with widgets like
