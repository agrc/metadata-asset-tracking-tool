## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Census blocks in Utah for comparing residential address counts between the MAF and SGID Address Points.

## Summary

This dataset contains features comparing the US Census Bureau residential address count compared to the LUCA program count as of 2017. These data was created in preparation for the 2020 Census.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The [Local Update of Census Addresses](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census/about/luca.html) (LUCA) program was created by the US Census Bureau to provide a means for city, county, and state governments to suggest edits to the residential address database used by the Bureau. This program helps to ensure accurate data collection and reporting for the Census. This dataset contains polygons representing Census blocks with fields indicating the Census Master Address File (MAF) count compared to the state compiled [address point](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/address-points/) count.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available for general reference and analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents a Census block as of the 2010 Census. Features contain the residential address count (resadd_ct), the Utah-compiled address count (utadd_ct) and the difference between these two counts (ut_cb_diff). These fields can be used to determine how many addresses were counted per Census block in the original MAF database as compared to what was counted as part of the LUCA program.

### How was the dataset created?

<!--- I have my guesstimates, but do we know who created this dataset and how it was done? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents Census block data as of 2010 and may not reflect current Census block boundaries, address counts, or LUCA participation. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
