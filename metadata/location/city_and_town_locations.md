## Brief Summary

Points dataset of cities and towns in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset contains point data for cities, towns, and non-populated locations in Utah and includes the name, county, and basic population information.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains points representing municipalities, county seats, populated areas, and major junctions in Utah. This dataset does not contain polygon boundaries, which can be found in the [Utah Municipal Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/municipal/) layer.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset includes the name of the city or town, the county it is located in, and the type of location (city, town, county seat, etc). The approximate population numbers included with each city and town are from the 2020 Census.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by digitizing points from [Utah Department of Transportation](https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/) highway maps. This dataset is updated as new cities and towns are officially registered with the Lieutenant Governor's Office.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations of city and towns only and does not describe the full geographic extent of municipalities in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
