### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset includes the name of the city or town, the county it is located in, and the type of location (city, town, county seat, etc). The approximate population numbers included with each city and town are from the 2010 Census.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset by digitizing points from [Utah Department of Transportation](https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/) highway maps. This dataset is updated as new cities and towns are officially registered with the Lieutenant Governor's Office.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations of city and towns only and does not describe the full geographic extent of municipalities in Utah. While cities and towns are correct, population numbers may not be current. Users should refer to the official [Census layers](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/demographic/) for current population estimates.
