## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

Building footprints of Utah

SGID10.LOCATION.Buildings was derived from building footprints generated by Microsoft for all 50 States https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints In some cases the pixel prediction algorithm used by Microsoft identified and created building footprints where no buildings existed. To flag potential errors, building footprints within 750 meters of known populated areas (SGID10.DEMOGRAPHIC.PopBlockAreas2010_Approx) and within 500 meters of an address point (SGID10.LOCATION.AddressPoints) were selected and indentified as being a likely structure, footprints falling outside these areas were identified as possible buildings in the 'TYPE' field. In addition, attributes were added for address, city, county, and zip where possible.

Utah Buildings was derived from building footprints created by Microsoft for all 50 States. This dataset contains building footprints generated by computer vision algorithms on satellite imagery.
