## Brief Summary

Polygon grid of standardized polygons for data display and analysis.

## Summary

This dataset contains hexagon polygons with a diameter of one kilometer.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Hexagons provide a useful framework for cartography and pattern display. Due to the tessellating nature of hexagons, natural curvature in data patterns can be more easily displayed.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general cartographic and analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each hexagon in this dataset measures a half kilometer on each side and one kilometer in diameter.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using the Esri ArcGIS Pro [Generate Tessellation](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/generatetesellation.htm) tool.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset provides an generalized framework for data display and analysis only and does not contain further attributes. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
