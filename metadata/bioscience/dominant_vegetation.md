## ID

## Brief Summary

Statewide distribution of dominant vegetation species in Utah.

## Summary

Dominant vegetation type for any given area in Utah.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes polygons representing the dominant vegetation type for a given area.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the dominant vegetation of an area. Vegetation can be distinguished by the [dominant vegetation code](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah::utah-dominant-vegetation-codes/about).

<!--- There are also a number of fields other than the code, such as ss1, ss2, etc and a "lab" field. Do we know the purpose of these fields or how they should be interpreted? --->

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset in 2001 using orthophoto quadrangles, aerial photography, and field mapping techniques derived from the [Utah Division of Wildlife Resources](https://wildlife.utah.gov/).

<!--- The original metadata was unclear as to whether we created this dataset using data derived from the DWR, or whether the DWR created this dataset and we just host the layer. --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The polygons in this dataset represent general areas of vegetation types and do not represent exact boundaries or current landscape conditions. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
