## ID

e2481e04-0a91-4cb3-810d-a71c4bfb5fdd

## Brief Summary

Statewide distribution of dominant vegetation species in Utah as of 2001.

## Summary

Polygon dataset of dominant vegetation species in Utah. This dataset contains approximate boundaries only and does not contain further details such as species density, abundance, or conservation status.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Dominant vegetation types are determined by the most abundant plant species that occupies a given area. This dataset contains polygons representing the geographical coverage of various dominant native species in Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the dominant vegetation of an area. Vegetation can be distinguished by the [dominant vegetation code](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah::utah-dominant-vegetation-codes/about).

### How was the dataset created?

The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources created this dataset in 2001 using orthophoto quadrangles, aerial photography, and field mapping techniques. This static dataset is currently hosted by UGRC.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The polygons in this dataset represent general areas of vegetation types and do not represent exact boundaries or current landscape conditions. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
