## Description

### What is the dataset?

Associations of governments, also called councils of governments, regional councils, or planning commissions, are coordinating bodies composed of several member counties. Each of Utah's 29 counties is a part of an association of governments. This dataset shows the county boundaries and indicates which association a county is in.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes. Boundaries for the associations for governments found throughout Utah can be displayed using the aog_name field.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon dataset represents the geographical area of a county in Utah. You can learn more about how these boundaries are created and maintained on the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) page.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using the existing county boundaries and information from the association of governments themselves.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the current arrangement of member counties and their associations of governments. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
