### What does the dataset represent

This dataset is developed wusing coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions. When necessary, this dataset is adjusted to conform to known physical features such as rivers or mountain ranges. This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but, rather a set of boundaries used for administrative purposes that conforms to logical & administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or township areas may cover the same geographic extent).
