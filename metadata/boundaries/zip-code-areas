## Brief Summary

Geographic extents of 5 digit zip codes.

The estimated geographic extents for all five digit ZIP codes in Utah that are not P.O. box only.

## Summary

Zone improvement program (ZIP) code boundaries are an ongoing effort to approximate the geographic extents of five digit ZIP codes as polygons. The dataset was produced using a combination of methods and is based on several sets of source data. Editing methods include:

- Using local ZIP code polygon data obtained from counties and cities.
- Identifying place locations (cities, towns, populated areas, etc.) from the postal service website and address information system (AIS) and building ZIP code boundaries around these places.
- Using the 2000 Census TIGER line fileâ€™s ZIP code attributes.

In addition, UGRC has used the locations of mailing addresses known to be valid to fine tune this dataset.

Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.

### What is the dataset?

This data was developed to assist in assigning a five-digit zip code to each street segment and address point in the Utah statewide data set.

The assigned zip codes are used to:

Determine the location to be used for geocoding addresses

Automate the development of data that needs to be aggregated by zip code

This data should not be used to determine the definitive zip code for addressing mail that will be sent through the US Postal Service.  The USPS web site or other official data should be used for this purpose.

This dataset represents an ongoing effort to approximate the geographic extents of 5 digit zip codes. The dataset was produced using a combination of methods and is based on several sets of source data. Methods include: 1 using local zip code polygon data obtained from counties and cities contained within these counties; 2 examining the 2000 Census TIGER line file's zip code attributes; and 3 using UGRC address grid quadrant boundaries to assign the zip code to segments within a boundary corresponding to a place location (city, town, places) from the postal service website and address information system (AIS). In addition, UGRC has used the locations of mailing addresses known to have valid zip codes to fine tune this dataset.
