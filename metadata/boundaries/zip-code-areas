Utah ZIP Code Areas

## Brief Summary

The estimated geographic extents for all five-digit ZIP codes in Utah that are not P.O. box only.

## Summary

This dataset includes the approximate geographic boundaries of every five-digit Zone Improvement Program (ZIP) code in Utah. ZIP codes are approximated based on the locations of known mailing addresses and are represented as polygons.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

ZIP codes were first introduced by the United State Postal Service (USPS) in 1963 to improve mail delivery. The first three digits of the five-digit code refer to the Sectional Center Facility (SCF), or the central processing facility for a given region's mail. The last two digits provide a more specific locale that the mail will be delivered to.

This dataset should not be used to determine the definitive zip code for addressing mail that will be sent through the US Postal Service.  The [USPS website](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm) or other official data should be used for this purpose.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was developed to provide a reference for assigning ZIP codes to features in the [Utah Roads](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/road-centerlines/) and [Utah Address Points](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/address-points/) datasets. The assigned zip codes are used to determine the location to be used for geocoding addresses as well asutomate the development of data that needs to be aggregated by ZIP code.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic area of a given ZIP code and includes information such as the city and county the code lies within.

### How was the dataset created?

The dataset was produced using a combination of methods and is based on several sets of source data. Editing methods include:

- Using local ZIP code polygon data obtained from counties and cities.
- Identifying place locations (cities, towns, populated areas, etc.) from the postal service website and address information system (AIS) and building ZIP code boundaries around these places.
- Using the 2000 Census TIGER line fileâ€™s ZIP code attributes.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents approximate boundaries only. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.
