Utah USFS Roadless Inventory

## ID

ae3e16a4-13a8-4af6-a977-b1989ad9880a

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas in Utah designated as roadless by the 2001 USFS Roadless Inventory.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygon boundaries for inventoried roadless areas (IRAs) managed by the United States Forest Service, including designated areas outside of IRAs. Other federally managed areas such as [wilderness areas](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/wilderness/) can be found in the [Boundary Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Roadless areas are regions within National Forests that are protected under [Roadless Area Conservation Rules](https://www.fs.usda.gov/main/roadless/2001rule). These areas are managed by the United States Forest Service (USFS) and include vast recreational opportunities with limited timber harvesting. These areas are not necessarily devoid of all roads, they simply contain fewer roads than surrounding areas. You can learn more about roadless areas on the [USFS website](https://www.fs.usda.gov/roadmain/roadless).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was originally developed to be used as supporting documentation for the [USFS Roadless Area Conservation Initiative](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5057895.pdf). This dataset is also suitable for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extend of a roadless area. Features include attributes such as the area name, USFS category, National Forest the area belongs to, USFS region, and area in acres.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created through a collaborative effort between the National Forests and USFS Regional Offices. This final dataset includes supplemental information on Special Designated Areas in addition to Inventoried Roadless Areas. This dataset is currently maintained by the USFS.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset includes Inventoried Roadless Areas derived from National Forest plans as of 2000. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or comments about this layer.
