## Brief Summary

Statewide polyline dataset of county boundaries for cartography and approximate boundary identification.

## Summary

This dataset contains polyline features only and does not contain further information such as county demographics.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polyline features representing administrative boundaries for all 29 counties in Utah.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset provides an administrative baseline for the current extent of each county in Utah and is suitable for cartography and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, rather, it contains a set of boundaries that conform to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two counties areas may cover the same geographic extent).

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this polyline layer using data from the [Utah Counties](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) polygons available on the SGID. All updates, corrections, or clarifications to the county boundaries represented in this dataset must first be filed with the [Lieutenant Governor's](https://ltgovernor.utah.gov/) office. Once approved, UGRC receives the updated data and adjusts the polygon boundaries accordingly.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects the most current and complete version of Utah county polyline boundaries that have been verified by the Lieutenant Governor's Office. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
