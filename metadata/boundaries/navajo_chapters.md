## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Navajo Nation chapter boundaries in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset includes polygon representations of Navajo Nation chapters found in and around Utah. This dataset is for general reference and cartographic purposes and is not a substitute for a legal land survey.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Navajo Nation is an independent governing body composed of five agencies found across Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. Each agency includes several chapters, which are the smallest and most local form of the Navajo Nation. Chapters are semi self-autonomous entities with elected delegates and central meetinghouses. You can learn more about the Navajo Nation on their [official website](https://www.navajo-nsn.gov/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate boundaries of a given chapter of the Navajo Nation. Features include attributes such as the chapter name and [FIPS](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips#FIPS1) code.

<!--- The attribute table also has a field labelled "aitsce". Do we know what this refers to? I found some information indicating it might refer to a census metric, but I wasn't sure about it since the values in that field are both integers and text. --->

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset using data submitted by local government partners. We maintain this dataset and update it as needed.

<!--- This was a guesstimate. Do we know how this dataset came to be? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is a cartographic representation of Navajo Nation chapter areas and does not include exact legal boundaries. For the current legal boundaries, refer to the [Utah Land Ownership](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/cadastre/land-ownership/) data layer available on the SGID.
