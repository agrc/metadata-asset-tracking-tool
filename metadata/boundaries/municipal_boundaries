## ID

6b60c759-74d6-4533-93f5-fed8cf32a748

## Brief Summary

Statewide polygon dataset of municipal boundaries for cartography and approximate boundary identification.

## Summary

Utah municipal boundaries defined by County Recorders' offices and certified by the Lieutenant Governor's Office. Updated boundaries from county authorities are aggregated by UGRC to produce this dataset.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset represents the 250+ municipalities in Utah as polygons that include information such as:

- Whether or not the municipality is a county seat
- Municipality population as of the 2020 Census
- Estimated population of the municipality as of January 1, 2022
- [GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-geographic-names-information-system-gnis#:~:text=The%20Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System%20(GNIS)%2C%20developed%20by%20the,and%20outlying%20areas%20of%20the) code

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

Municipal boundary data are used in a variety of sectors, including city planning, real estate, and public services. In addition to displaying where current municipalities lie, you can find a map of recent annexations on our [blog](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). Municipal data can help the public see where [annexations](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2023-01-30-municipal-boundaries-final-update-for-2022/) have occurred and where [new cities and towns](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2018-09-04-newest-city-added-to-state-and-municipal-boundary-updates-for-third-quarter-2018/) have been established in Utah.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but, rather a set of polygon boundaries used for general purposes that conforms to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent).

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was first created through a cooperative effort between the [Governor's Office of Planning and Budget](https://gopb.utah.gov/), [UDOT](https://udot.utah.gov/), the [Utah State Tax Commission](https://incometax.utah.gov/), and UGRC. Coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions was used to create a polygon feature for each municipality in Utah. All features have been adjusted to the current Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) points.

The original dataset incorporated municipalities in the state that were extant as of 1992. Updates for further annexations and disconnections have been completed with the cooperative efforts of the State Tax Commission, [Property Tax Division](https://propertytax.utah.gov/), and UGRC. Updates to the municipal boundaries proposed by counties or other entities must be certified through the [Lieutenant Governor's Office](https://ltgovernor.utah.gov/).

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the latest and most complete geospatial resource for municipal boundaries in the state of Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with any questions or concerns about this dataset.
