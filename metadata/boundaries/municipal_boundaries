## Description

Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.

### What is the dataset?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but, rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes that conforms to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

### What does the dataset represent?

Population Estimates are from July 1, 2022.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was first created through a cooperative effort between the [Governor's Office of Planning and Budget](https://gopb.utah.gov/), [UDOT](https://udot.utah.gov/), the [Utah State Tax Commission](https://incometax.utah.gov/), and UGRC. Coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions was used to create a polygon feature for each municipality in Utah. All features have been adjusted to the current Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) points.

The original dataset incorporated municipalities in the state that were extant as of 1992. Since then, 

 All incorporated municipalities in the state through dates varying from 1984 to 1992 were initially represented.

 Updates for further annexations and disconnections were completed with the cooperative efforts of the State Tax Commission, [Property Tax Division](https://propertytax.utah.gov/), and UGRC, and currentness now ranges from 1993 through the revisions date shown in the metadata with updates from local government where needed to include new incorporations, corrections, and substantially changed boundaries due to annexation.
