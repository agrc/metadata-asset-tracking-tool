## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of historic and current county boundaries in Utah as certified by the Lt. Governor's Office.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons indicating the historic and current boundaries of all 29 counties in Utah. It shows boundary adjustments from the last twenty years and contains links to documentation for most boundary changes.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons representing both the historic and current extent of county boundaries in Utah. Each county has multiple polygons, with one representing the original extent and a few others indicating boundary changes throughout the years. For current certified county boundaries only, please see the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) dataset available on the SGID.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset provides an administrative baseline for the current and historic extent of each county in Utah and is suitable for cartography and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of a county at the time it was updated. The doc_loc field shows where documentation for change can be located, and/or the reason for the change. The update_type field indicates whether the polygon is an adjustment or is the original boundary. This dataset also specifies what [state plane coordinate system](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-state-plane-coordinate-system-can-gps-provide-coordinates-these-values#:~:text=The%20State%20Plane%20Coordinate%20System%20(SPCS)%2C%20which%20is%20only,the%20state's%20size%20and%20shape.) each county is in.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this dataset using coordinate geometry ([COGO](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/editing/introduction-to-cogo.htm)) from legal descriptions provided by each county. When necessary, this dataset was adjusted to conform to known physical features such as rivers or mountain ranges as indicated in the legal descriptions. Details on how the boundaries were drawn can be found on the official [Municipal Certifications](https://municert.utah.gov/) website.

All updates, corrections, or clarifications to the county boundaries represented in this dataset must first be filed with the [Lieutenant Governor's](https://ltgovernor.utah.gov/) office. Once approved, UGRC receives the updated data and adjusts the polygon boundaries accordingly. These updated polygons are added to this dataset so they can be displayed in contrast to previous boundaries.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects county boundaries changes within the last twenty years only. These administrative boundaries are not a substitute for a legal land survey. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
