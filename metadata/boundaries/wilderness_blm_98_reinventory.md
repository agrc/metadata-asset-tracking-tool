## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons representing areas that were shown to have wilderness characteristics by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) during a statewide inventory completed in 1998. Wilderness characteristics were described in the Wilderness Act of 1964 and help dictate which lands become candidates for inclusion in the [National Wilderness Preservation System](https://www.wilderness.org/articles/article/national-wilderness-preservation-system). You can learn more about the inventory methods and results in the official [Utah Wilderness Inventory Report](https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/Utah%20Wilderness%20Inventory%201999.pdf).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the geographic extent of an area deemed to have wilderness characteristics. Features in this dataset include the name, status, and BLM administrative unit the area is located in.

### How was the dataset created?

The BLM originally created this dataset and submitted it to UGRC so it could be shared with the public. This static dataset is maintained by the BLM.
