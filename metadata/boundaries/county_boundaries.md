# Title

Utah County Boundaries

## ID

b2c8af56-3d92-4aa7-ac2f-b1388051d9ce

## Brief Summary

A statewide polygon dataset of county boundaries for cartography and approximate boundary identification.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons for all 29 counties in Utah, where the perimeter of the polygon represents the county boundary. Each polygon also contains county population as of the [2020 Census](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/utah-population-change-between-census-decade.html) and current approximate population.

## Description

### What is the dataset

This dataset represents each county as a polygon with information such as the Entity Number and [GNIS](https://www.usgs.gov/tools/geographic-names-information-system-gnis) code. This dataset also specifies what [state plane coordinate system](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-state-plane-coordinate-system-can-gps-provide-coordinates-these-values#:~:text=The%20State%20Plane%20Coordinate%20System%20(SPCS)%2C%20which%20is%20only,the%20state's%20size%20and%20shape.) the county is in (North, Central, or South). Population data is derived from the 2020 Census (pop_lastcensus) and the Census Bureau's [Population Estimates Program](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html) (poplastest).

### What is the purpose of the dataset

This dataset provides an administrative baseline for the current extent of each county in Utah. Boundary data is often used in analysis, especially within the transportation, real estate, and natural resources sectors.

### What does the dataset represent

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, rather, it contains a set of boundaries used for general purposes that conforms to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two counties areas may cover the same geographic extent).

### How was the dataset created

UGRC developed this dataset using coordinate geometry ([COGO](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/editing/introduction-to-cogo.htm)) from legal descriptions provided by each county. When necessary, this dataset was adjusted to conform to known physical features such as rivers or mountain ranges.

All updates, corrections, or clarifications to the county boundaries represented in this dataset must first be filed with the [Lieutenant Governor's](https://ltgovernor.utah.gov/) office. Once approved, UGRC receives the updated data and adjusts the polygon boundaries accordingly.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset

This dataset reflects the most current and complete version of Utah county boundaries that have been verified by the Lieutenant Governor's Office. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.
