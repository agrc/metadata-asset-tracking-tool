# Title

Utah ZIP Code Areas

## ID

1d4cbfba-75da-4d7c-a9bb-b32902b0af6d

## Brief Summary

The estimated geographic extent for all ZIP codes in Utah (excluding those that are PO Box only).

## Summary

This dataset includes the approximate geographic boundaries of every five-digit Zone Improvement Program (ZIP) code in Utah. ZIP code boundaries are approximated based on the locations of known mailing addresses and are represented as polygons.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

ZIP codes were first introduced by the United State Postal Service (USPS) in 1963 to improve mail delivery. The first three digits of the five-digit code refer to the Sectional Center Facility (SCF), or the central processing facility for a given region's mail. The last two digits provide a more specific locale that the mail will be delivered to.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was developed to provide a reference for assigning ZIP codes to features in the SGID such as the [Utah Roads](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/transportation/road-centerlines/) and [Utah Address Points](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/location/address-points/) datasets. Utah ZIP Code Areas have also been used in a variety of analyses. For example, [one such analysis](https://gis.utah.gov/blog/2024-05-17-utah-housing-affordability-map/) maps housing affordability in Utah by ZIP code, providing the user a simple means of comparing the real estate market between general areas.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic area of a given ZIP code and includes information such as the city and county the code lies within. These polygons were derived from a database of road polylines originally used to improve mail delivery for carriers. UGRC has translated that polyline data into polygons for visualization and analysis purposes.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC produced this dataset from multiple data sources using a combination of methods. Some of these editing methods include using local ZIP code polygon data obtained from counties and cities and identifying place locations from the USPS Address Information System ([AIS](https://postalpro.usps.com/address-quality/ais-viewer)). [TIGER](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/guidance/tiger-data-products-guide.html) data from the 2000 Census was also used to approximate ZIP code attributes.

UGRC works with local authorities to update ZIP Code Areas as needed. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions concerning this dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents approximate boundaries only and serves as a reference for cartographic and general analytic purposes. This dataset should not be used to determine the definitive ZIP code for addressing mail that will be sent through the US Postal Service. The [USPS website](https://tools.usps.com/zip-code-lookup.htm) should be used for this purpose.
