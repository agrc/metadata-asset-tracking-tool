## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of National Forest boundaries for cartography and general reference purposes.

## Summary

Polygon dataset of National Forest boundaries as derived from the GSTC SOC database. UGRC maintains these boundaries in collaboration with local government partners.

<!--- We are listed as the source for this dataset, is that the case? Do we maintain it? The metadata wasn't entirely clear whether we maintain these boundaries or how USFS themselves is involved. --->

## Description

National forest boundaries submitted for the President's Roadless Area Initiative.

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons representing National Forest boundaries in Utah. This dataset contains administrative boundaries only and does not include locations of ranger stations, campsites, trails, or other entities.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

UGRC created this dataset for use in former president Bill Clinton's [Roadless Area Initiative](https://www.fs.usda.gov/roadmain/roadless) for the lower 48 states. This dataset was originally used to spatially edgematch National Forest boundaries and [Inventoried Roadless Area](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46504) boundaries found in Utah. Now, this layer serves a general reference and cartographic resource.

<!--- Did we create this dataset? The original metadata wasn't very clear. --->

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate geographic boundaries of a National Forest. Features contain the name of the forested area and which National Forest it is a part of.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was derived from the GSTC SOC data system and an Oracle database, it was comprised of Cartographic Feature Files (CFFs) that used the [Spatial Data Engine](https://support.esri.com/en-us/technical-paper/spatial-database-engine-sde-270) from Esri. Originally created in 1999, this dataset has since been updated with new data submitted for the Roadless Area Initiative.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete representation of National Forest boundaries in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
