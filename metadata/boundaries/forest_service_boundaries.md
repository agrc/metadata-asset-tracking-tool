## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

National forest boundaries submitted for the President's Roadless Area Initiative.

This dataset was created to use as a reference in spatially edgematching all of the National Forest Inventoried Roadless Area (IRA) data for the President's Roadless Area Initiative for the lower 48 states. Alaska boundaries are maintained in separate datasets.

This dataset contains National Forest boundaries for the State of Utah. This dataset includes administrative unit boundaries, derived primarily from the GSTC SOC data system, comprised of Cartographic Feature Files (CFFs), using ESRI Spatial Data Engine (SDE) and an Oracle database. The data that was available in SOC was extracted on November 10, 1999. Some of the data that had been entered into SOC was outdated, and some national forest boundaries had never been entered for a variety of reasons. GSTC has edited this data in places where it was questionable or missing, to match the National Forest Inventoried Roadless Area data submitted for the President's Roadless Area Initiative.
