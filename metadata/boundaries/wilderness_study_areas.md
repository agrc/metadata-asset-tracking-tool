## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of BLM Wilderness Study Areas for general reference and cartographic purposes.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygon boundaries of Wilderness Study Areas (WSA) and other areas in Utah that have been considered for WSA designation in the past. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not include current status of WSAs or other management details.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

A Wilderness Study Area (WSA) is an area of undeveloped land managed by the [Bureau of Land Management](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/wilderness) (BLM) that may be considered for addition to the [National Wilderness Preservation System](https://www.wilderness.org/articles/article/national-wilderness-preservation-system). This dataset contains polygons representing WSA boundaries in Utah, as well as several areas that are not official WSAs but are managed similarly due to congressional direction.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

WSA data are used for natural resource management, [NEPA](https://www.epa.gov/nepa) documentation, and recreational planning.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the approximate geographic extent of a WSA in Utah. Features in this dataset include the WSA name, area in acres, and WSA type. In addition to designated WSAs, this dataset also includes areas that are not WSAs but are managed similarly or were previously considered for wilderness designation. These areas can be distinguished by the WSA_TYPE field.

### How was the dataset created?

The BLM digitized this dataset using 1:24,000 scale quadrangle paper maps from the United States Geological Survey. The layer has since been adjusted using data available from the Geographic Coordinate Database.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents the most current and complete version of WSAs and similarly designated areas in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
