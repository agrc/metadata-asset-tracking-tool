## Description

The Wilderness BLM WSAs dataset contains all the BLM Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). It also identifies lands that are not WSAs but were administratively endorsed for wilderness by the BLM in the 1991 wilderness study reports sent to the President and Congress. It also identifies acquired lands that are not WSAs, but are managed as if they were WSAs as a result of congressional direction.

BLM and USFS designated wilderness areas in Utah
