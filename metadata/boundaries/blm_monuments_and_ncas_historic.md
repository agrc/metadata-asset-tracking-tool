## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of historic BLM national monuments and national conservation area boundaries in Utah.

## Summary

This dataset displays the historic boundaries of BLM National Monuments and National Conservation Areas in Utah prior to boundary adjustments made to [Bears Ears National Monument](https://www.blm.gov/visit/bears-ears-national-monument) and [Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/utah/grand-staircase-escalante-national-monument) in 2017.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Bureau of Land Management (BLM)'s National Conservation Lands system include 19 national monuments in nine western states. This dataset includes BLM National Conservation Areas and National Monuments found in Utah. The polygons included in this dataset represent the historic spatial extent of the Grand Staircase Escalante and Bears Ears National Monuments prior to being [reduced by the Trump administration in 2017](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-modifying-bears-ears-national-monument/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created to display the historic boundaries of BLM National Conservation Areas and National Monuments in Utah. For current boundaries of these areas, please see the current [Utah BLM Monuments and NCAs](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah::utah-blm-monuments-and-ncas/about) dataset available on the SGID.

### What does the dataset represent?

Descriptions of each type of polygon found in this feature class can be found on Page 21 of the National Landscape Conservation System (NLCS) [Implementation Guidelines](https://www.blm.gov/sites/blm.gov/files/uploads/IM2011-057_att1.pdf).

### How was the dataset created?

Features included in this dataset have been designated under either Public Law or Presidential Proclamation through the Antiquities Act of 1906. UGRC created this feature class using legislatively mandated boundary descriptions and coordinate geometry.

<!--- This is another one of my best guesstimates. Do we have further details on how the dataset was created? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents historic boundaries for BLM National Conservation Areas and National Monuments in Utah as of 2017. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.

<!--- While doing research for this layer, I noticed that the Biden administration adjusted the boundaries for Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante again in 2021, does the current dataset (the one that isn't historic) reflect those most recent changes? --->
