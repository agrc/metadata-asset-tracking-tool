## Brief Summary

Official polygon dataset of geographic extent of the state of Utah.

## Summary

This dataset includes a polygon feature representing the current Utah State boundary as certified through the Lieutenant Governor's Office.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset depicts the Utah State Boundary as digitized from the United States Geologic Survey ([USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/)) 7.5 minute quad map series. The boundary is coincident with the outer boundary of the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) dataset.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset provides an administrative representation for the current geographic extent of the state of Utah. It is suitable for cartography and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset represents the boundary of the State of Utah at a scale of 1:24000.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this dataset using the 7.5 quad maps available through USGS. Minor adjustments were made in 2014 to align with the Newest PLSS-GCDB layers from BLM (CadNSDIv2). The most significant adjustment was made along the Wyoming and Summit County lines. All updates, corrections, or clarifications to the boundary represented in this dataset must first be filed with the Lieutenant Governor's office. Once approved, UGRC receives the updated data and adjusts the polygon boundary accordingly.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the latest and most complete geospatial resource for the Utah State boundary. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with any questions or concerns about this dataset.
