## Brief Summary

## Summary

The Utah State boundary is maintained by UGRC with the help of many state, county, and local entities. Changes and updates are through certification by the Lt. Governor's Office sent in by City and County Recorders offices. All features are adjusted to the current Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) points.

This data is developed with coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions. When necessary the data is adjusted to conform to known physical features. This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but, rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes that conforms to logical & administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or township areas may cover the same geographic extent).

The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset. Users are encouraged to attribute content to: State of Utah, SGID. The metro townships boundary dataset is maintained by UGRC in partnership with state and local government.

The boundaries are revised as documents are filed with the Lt. Governor's Office.
