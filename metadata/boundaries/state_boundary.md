## Brief Summary

Official polygon dataset of geographic extent of the state of Utah.

## Summary

This dataset depicts the Utah State Boundary as digitized from USGS 7.5 minute quad map series. The boundary is coincident with the outer boundary of the [Utah County Boundaries](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/boundaries/county/) dataset. Minor adjustments were made to align with the Newest PLSS-GCDB layers from BLM (CadNSDIv2). The most significant adjustment was made along the Wyoming and Summit County lines.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset provides an administrative baseline for the current geographic extent of the state of Utah and is suitable for cartography and general analytic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but, rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes that conforms to logical & administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or township areas may cover the same geographic extent).

### How was the dataset created?

The polygon feature for the Utah State Boundary was created using coordinate geometry [(COGO)](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/editing/introduction-to-cogo.htm) from legal descriptions. All features have been adjusted to the current Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) points.

All updates, corrections, or clarifications to the boundary represented in this dataset must first be filed with the Lieutenant Governor's office. Once approved, UGRC receives the updated data and adjusts the polygon boundary accordingly.
