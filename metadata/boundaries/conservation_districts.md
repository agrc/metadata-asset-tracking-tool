## Brief Summary

The State of Utah has 38 conservation districts established to oversee soil erosion programs. In addition to their focus on reducing soil erosion, these districts also address other important resource concerns such as improving water quality, improving wildlife habitat, conserving water, eradicating invasive weeds, as well as other issues that could potentially impact the natural resources in the State of Utah.

This dataset shows the Conservation District (formerly Soil Conservation District) district boundaries created by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) in Utah. This dataset was created to update district and zone boundaries to conform to the boundary descriptions as approved by the Utah Soil Conservation Commission.

The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). This dataset is maintained by the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF) in cooperation with UGRC.
