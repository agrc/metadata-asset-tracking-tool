## Description

### What is the dataset?

Conservation districts were originally established in 1937 as a means of addressing soil erosion at the local level. Today, the state of Utah maintains 39 conservation districts that oversee resource management objectives such as improving water quality, improving wildlife habitat, conserving water, and eradicating invasive weeds. You can learn more about conservation districts on the [Utah Department of Agriculture and Food](https://ag.utah.gov/farmers/conservation-division/conservation-districts/) (UDAF) website.

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?
