### What is the dataset?

A health care district is composed of one or several counties that are grouped together for public health administration purposes. Health care districts are managed by a local or regional Department of Health and assist the communities in their jurisdiction with clinical services, emergency preparedness, and data collection on diseases and other health concerns. There are 12 health care districts in Utah, six of which contain singular counties (Davis, Salt Lake, Summit, Tooele, Utah, and Wasatch).
