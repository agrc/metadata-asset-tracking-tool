Utah Health Small Statistical Areas Obesity and Activity

## ID

6a9e98cd-d745-4ef3-9790-f072056036cf

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Health and Human Services analysis areas with addition health statistics.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing small statistical areas as defined by the [Utah Department of Health and Human Services](https://dhhs.utah.gov/) (DHHS) for the year 2020. In addition to the polygon boundaries, this dataset contains statistics on physical activity, obesity, and population density.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Small statistical areas are zones defined by DHHS that have an approximate population of 8,000 to 86,000 people. These zones were first developed in 1997 and are used to aggregate data for public health research. This dataset displays a variety of metrics related to health and physical activity for each of the small statistical areas.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each feature in this dataset represents the geographic extent of a small statistical area and includes the ID, name, population as of 2017, population density, percent of adults that [physically active](https://heal.utah.gov/physical-activity-recommendations/), and percent of adults that are considered medically obese.

### How was the dataset created?

The Office of Public Health Assessment at DHHS developed this layer using the [Utah Local Health District and Small Area Designation Algorithm](https://ibis.utah.gov/ibisph-view/pdf/resource/Algorithm.pdf). They defined small areas based on ZIP Codes and county boundaries. The statistics in this dataset were collected and aggregated by DHHS.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

The metrics for physical activity and obesity rates in this dataset may not reflect current statistics in Utah. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
