## Summary

This dataset contains point locations of health care facilities throughout Utah. Each facility has been licensed by the Division of Licensing and Background Checks (DLBC) under the authority of the [Utah Department of Health and Human Services](https://dhhs.utah.gov/) (DHHS). We developed this layer using [tabular data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT8pLW5yVrV9EY811pE3leFw9u65FtXkMaADaYYdBi0zpjAhrIhaGDQpdQA-jPn8D07DxStjKcWXUcF/pubhtml?gid=1835834361&single=true) from the DHHS.
