## Brief Summary

Points dataset representing healthcare facilities such as clinics, hospitals, and surgical centers.

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations of health care facilities throughout Utah. Each facility has been licensed by the Division of Licensing and Background Checks (DLBC) under the authority of the [Utah Department of Health and Human Services](https://dhhs.utah.gov/) (DHHS). We developed this layer using [tabular data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT8pLW5yVrV9EY811pE3leFw9u65FtXkMaADaYYdBi0zpjAhrIhaGDQpdQA-jPn8D07DxStjKcWXUcF/pubhtml?gid=1835834361&single=true) from the DHHS.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Licensed health care facilities in Utah are categorized by the following levels of care:

- Home Health
- Assisted Living Type I
- Assisted Living Type II
- Small Health Care Facility Type N
- Intermediate Care Facility/Nursing Facility
- Skilled Nursing Facility
- Hospital
- Hospice

In addition to these types, this dataset also includes birthing centers, ambulatory surgical centers, and other facilities. Licensed health care facilities are regularly inspected to ensure compliance with state and federal health and safety standards.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset may be used to find addresses of healthcare facilities and serves as a mapping tool for many information pages and find-a-doctor lookups. Further healthcare-related data can be found in the [Health Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/health/).

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point represents the address point of a given healthcare facility and includes attributes such as the facility name, address, license type and capacity. Points are placed on or near the main structure of the facility.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC developed this dataset using the annual [Health Facilities Report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT8pLW5yVrV9EY811pE3leFw9u65FtXkMaADaYYdBi0zpjAhrIhaGDQpdQA-jPn8D07DxStjKcWXUcF/pubhtml?gid=1835834361&single=true) from the the DHHS. We update this dataset annually with newly registered healthcare facilities submitted by the Health Facilities Licensing section within the Division of Licensing and Background Checks at the Utah Department of Health and Human Services.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is updated annually to include current healthcare facilities in Utah. Facilities that are added in between updates may not be reflected in this dataset. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
