## ID

34f8331f-c0d9-48d6-83d9-adcd0ae28302

## Brief Summary

Polygons based on zip codes used by the Utah Department of Health and Human Services for statistical analysis and reporting.

## Summary

Previous versions of the Small Health Statistical Areas datasets are available in our [ArcGIS Online Shelf](https://utah.maps.arcgis.com/home/group.html?id=8765687b7b0545668fff02d1b750f7a9#overview).

## Description

### What is the dataset?

First developed by the Department of Health in 1997, Small Health Statistics Areas allow for more meaningful analysis by reducing areas to the smallest unit where there is enough data to be reliable and the area is similar in characteristics.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The Utah Department of Health and Human Services uses this dataset as a framework for more meaningful, focused statistical analysis. This dataset has been made available to the wider public for general research and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates a geographic area that has an approximate population of 8,000 to 86,000 people as of the 2020 Census.

<!--- This dataset has a field called 'SmallAreaNumber' which I initially thought was an ID number for each small area, but some of the numbers in the field are decimals, which makes me think that maybe it represents something else. Do we know what this number indicates? --->

### How was the dataset created?

The "Utah Small Health Statistics Areas" feature layer was developed by the Office of Public Health Assessment, Utah Department of Health using the Utah Local Health District and Small Area Designation Algorithm (see [https://ibis.health.utah.gov/pdf/resource/Algorithm.pdf]). Small Areas are defined based on ZIP Codes, population size, local health district and county boundaries, similarity of ZIP Code area income levels, community political boundaries, and input from local community representatives.

The "Utah Small Health Statistics Areas" was developed by the Utah Department of Health by combining neighboring ZIP code areas to create 99 small areas ranging in population of approximately 8,000 to 86,000 persons. In some instances a small area may not have a contiguous boundary, in these cases the small area is represented with multiple polygons. The feature layer was developed in 1997 by the Office of Public Health Assessment and revised in 2020.
