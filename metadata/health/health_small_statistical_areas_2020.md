## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

Areas based on zip codes used by the Utah Department of Health and Human Services for statistical analysis and reporting.

First developed by the Department of Health in 1997, Small Health Statistics Areas allow for more meaningful analysis by reducing areas to the smallest unit where there is enough data to be reliable and the area is similar in characteristics. The areas are created by combining neighboring ZIP code areas to create areas ranging in population of approximately 8,000 to 86,000 persons. In some instances a small area may not have a contiguous boundary, in these cases the small area is represented with multiple polygons.

The "Utah Small Health Statistics Areas" was developed by the Utah Department of Health by combining neighboring ZIP code areas to create 99 small areas ranging in population of approximately 8,000 to 86,000 persons. In some instances a small area may not have a contiguous boundary, in these cases the small area is represented with multiple polygons. The feature layer was developed in 1997 by the Office of Public Health Assessment and revised in 2020. The purpose for this feature layer is to allow for more meaningful analysis by reducing areas to the smallest unit where there is enough data to be reliable and the area is similar.

The "Utah Small Health Statistics Areas" feature layer was developed by the Office of Public Health Assessment, Utah Department of Health using the Utah Local Health District and Small Area Designation Algorithm (see [https://ibis.health.utah.gov/pdf/resource/Algorithm.pdf]). Small Areas are defined based on ZIP Codes, population size, local health district and county boundaries, similarity of ZIP Code area income levels, community political boundaries, and input from local community representatives.
