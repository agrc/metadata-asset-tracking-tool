## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

The emergency medical services dataset includes locations where EMS personnel are stationed or based out of, or where EMS equipment is stored and ready to use. These include ambulance services, including transportation only services, except for ambulance services located at and operated by a hospital (independent ambulance service co-located with a hospital are included). Records with "-DOD" appended to the end of the [NAME] value are located on a military base, as defined by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) military installations and military range boundaries. This dataset is comprised completely of license-free data.

Emergency Medical Services data provide a resource for emergency management planning, coordination with outside entities in disaster areas and assessing adequacy of total emergency medical services capability in a given area.
