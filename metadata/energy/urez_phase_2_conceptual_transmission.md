Utah UREZ Phase 2 Conceptual Transmission

## ID

## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of electrical lines in Utah as determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2008.

## Summary

This dataset contains polylines representing major existing, planned, and conceptual electrical transmission corridors. This layer was developed as part of the UREZ Task Force Phase 2 assessment of Utah renewable energy resources. You can access other renewable energy layers through the [Energy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains polylines representing electrical transmission lines that were in various stages of the planning process as of 2010. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force and their goals on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset was created as a model to estimate the cost of delivering resources from the UREZ study areas to load centers in and outside of Utah. This layer has been used in multiple energy analyses both performed by the UREZ Task Force and by other state and regional government entities.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polyline in this dataset indicates the approximate path for an existing, planned, or conceptual electrical transmission line. Features in this dataset include the data source, line ID, length in miles, label, and status as of 2010.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the UREZ Task Force as part of their Phase 1 assessment of Utah energy resources.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents both existing transmission lines and a theoretical network for future electricity planning considerations. This layer is for general analytic purposes only and does not reflect all currently operational transmission lines in Utah.
