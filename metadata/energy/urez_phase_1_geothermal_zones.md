# Title

Utah UREZ Phase 1 Geothermal Zones

## ID

71af79fb-8345-4a6d-aac1-0622c6fbfeff

## Brief Summary

Potential areas for geothermal energy development as determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2008.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons that display areas for potential geothermal energy development. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not include further details on development costs or potential energy output. You can access other renewable energy layers through the [Energy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source that can be artificially extracted as heat energy from the earth's crust. The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains polygons representing areas that the UREZ Task Force determined to be viable for future geothermal energy development. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates an area with potential for geothermal energy development as determined by the UREZ Task Force' initial [Phase 1 inventory](https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/misc_pubs/MP-09-1.pdf). Features in this dataset include the area name and any comments left by the UREZ Task Force.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the UREZ Task Force as part of their Phase 1 assessment of Utah lands.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate areas for geothermal energy development as determined by a 2008 study. These areas may not reflect current geothermal energy projects or regions where future projects are possible.
