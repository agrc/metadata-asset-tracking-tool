## Brief Summary

Points dataset of geothermal energy projects as determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2010.

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations for geothermal energy projects found in Utah as of a 2010 inventory by the UREZ Task Force. You can access other renewable energy layers through the [Energy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source that can be artificially extracted as heat energy from the earth's crust. The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains point locations of geothermal energy projects that were under development or in operation as of September 2010. These projects were included in the [UREZ Task Force Phase 2 Final Report](https://geology.utah.gov/docs/emp/UREZphase2.pdf). You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each point in this dataset indicates the approximate location of a current or past geothermal energy project. Features in this dataset include the project name, megawatt output, gigawatt hour output, and UREZ name.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the UREZ Task Force as part of their Phase 2 assessment of Utah energy resources.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate locations of geothermal energy projects as of 2010. These areas may not reflect current geothermal energy projects or regions where future projects are possible.
