Oil and Gas Wells Down Holes

## Brief Summary

Points dataset of horizontally drilled oil and gas wells from the Oil, Gas, and Mining Division of the Utah Department of Natural Resources.

<!--- The original metadata mentions that this dataset contains bottom hole data for horizontally drilled wells only, but I noticed that under the field "constructtype" some were listed as vertical. Does this refer to something else, or are there vertically drilled wells as well as horizontal ones in this dataset? --->

## Summary

This dataset contains point locations for horizontally drilled oil and gas bottom holes. Bottom holes, the deepest part of a given well, serve as a useful data point in natural resources analyses and public planning.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Oil and gas wells in Utah are managed by the Utah Department of Natural Resources [Division of Oil, Gas and Mining](https://ogm.utah.gov/) (OGM). This dataset contains point locations for horizontally drilled oil and gas bottom holes. Other oil and gas well points can be found on the [Utah Oil and Gas Wells](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/oil-gas-wells/) layer available on the SGID.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset serves as a reference for the bottom hole locations of horizontally drilled oil and gas wells in Utah. It has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Points in this dataset contain attributes such as the API number, geographic coordinates, and construction status of the well.

<!--- Do we have a document with field definitions somewhere? If not, that's alright, I was justhinking it might be helpful to include information on what the codes in "constructtype" and constructstatus" mean. --->

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was developed by contractors sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection Council. It is actively maintained by the OGM. Updated oil and gas well information is added to this dataset automatically on a nightly basis.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete representation of oil and gas wells bottom hole points in Utah. Questions or concerns about this dataset can be directed to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) or [OGM](https://ogm.utah.gov/og-contact-us/).
