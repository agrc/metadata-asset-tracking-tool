# Title

Utah UREZ Phase 1 Solar Zones

## ID

666f6286-d7bf-43a0-9cd8-a713edd9c671

## Brief Summary

Potential areas for solar energy development as determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2008.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons that display areas for potential solar energy development. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not include further details on development costs or potential energy output. You can access other renewable energy layers through the [Energy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

This dataset depicts renewable solar resources identified by the Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) task force.

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains polygons representing areas that the UREZ Task Force determined to be viable for future solar energy development. These areas do not include private homes or businesses where solar energy is already in use but rather represents areas for commercial solar development on a large scale. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates an area with potential for solar energy development as determined by the UREZ Task Force' initial [Phase 1 inventory](https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/misc_pubs/MP-09-1.pdf).

<!--- The only field in this dataset beyond the XID is one labelled as DNR, but the values are all decimals so it doesn't seem to be an ID from the Dept. of Natural Resources. Do we have any idea what this DNR field refers to? --->

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the UREZ Task Force as part of their Phase 1 assessment of Utah lands.

<!--- Was UGRC involved in the creation of this dataset? --->

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate areas for solar energy development as determined by a 2008 study. These areas may not reflect current solar projects or regions where future projects are possible.
