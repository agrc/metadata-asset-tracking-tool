## ID

## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of drill paths for oil and gas wells from the Oil, Gas, and Mining Division of the Utah Department of Natural Resources.

## Summary

This dataset contains polyline features representing paths of oil and gas wells in Utah. The data are actively maintained by the Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

Oil and gas wells in Utah are managed by the Utah Department of Natural Resources [Division of Oil, Gas and Mining](https://ogm.utah.gov/) (OGM). This dataset contains polyline drill paths for oil and gas wells. Other oil and gas well data can be found on the SGID [Energy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset serves as a reference for the drill paths of oil and gas wells in Utah. It has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each drill path in this dataset is represented by a polyline feature indicating the path from the surface location of the well to the bottom hole. Features contain attributes such as the API number, construction type, and construction status of the well.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was developed by contractors sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection Council. It is actively maintained by the OGM. Updated oil and gas well information is added to this dataset automatically on a nightly basis.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is the most current and complete representation of oil and gas wells drill paths available in Utah. In cases where no directional path data is present, the path between the surface hole and bottom hole is interpolated as a straight polyline. The [Oil and Gas Wells](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/oil-gas-wells/) layer available in the SGID may be used as an additional resource to find directional survey data. Wells can be identified using the API number of well name and directional data, if it exists, can be found under Final Survey. Questions or concerns about this dataset can be directed to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) or [OGM](https://ogm.utah.gov/og-contact-us/).
