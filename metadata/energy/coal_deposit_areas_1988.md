Coal deposit areas include regions where coal seams, coal fields, or coal beds have been identified and inventoried by the Utah Division of Oil, Gas, and Mining.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate area where current or past coal deposits have been inventoried, mined, or surveyed.

### How was the dataset created?

This layer was developed using data collected by the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining from sources created by other government agencies and private entities. This layer was originally compiled in 1988 and has since been updated with newly inventoried coal deposit areas.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents approximate coal deposits from a previous inventory of Utah energy resources. These data may not reflect current coal mining areas or projects.
