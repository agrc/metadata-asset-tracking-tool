## Brief Summary

Surface location of oil and gas wells from the Department of Natural Resources, Oil, Gas, and Mining Division.

## Summary

This data was developed by contractors sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection Council and provides the opportunity for the Division to collect more descriptive down-hole information for each wellbore permitted and drilled. Initially, much of the down-hole information will not be available because there was no place to save it in the previous databases. Eventually, as new wells are drilled and old legacy data is entered, more descriptive data will become available for the wells in Utah.

These data include the API code, well and company name, account number, filed number, field name, elevation, locations coordinates, lease numbers, well type and status, total cumulative oil, gas and water, and more.
