## Description

### What is the dataset?

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

and provides the opportunity for the Division to collect more descriptive down-hole information for each wellbore permitted and drilled.

### What does the dataset represent?

These data include the API code, well and company name, account number, filed number, field name, elevation, locations coordinates, lease numbers, well type and status, total cumulative oil, gas and water, and more.

### How was the dataset created?

This data was developed by contractors sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection Council

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

Initially, much of the down-hole information will not be available because there was no place to save it in the previous databases. Eventually, as new wells are drilled and old legacy data is entered, more descriptive data will become available for the wells in Utah.
