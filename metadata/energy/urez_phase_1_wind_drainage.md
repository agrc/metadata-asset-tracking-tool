Utah UREZ Phase 1 Wind Drainage

## ID

d34f3737-32ed-4767-8a15-9a6b6b98180e

## Brief Summary

Points dataset of locations where canyon wind energy development may be possible.

## Summary

This dataset indicates locations where wind energy projects may be possible due to high winds in or near a canyon entrance. These locations were determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2008. Further UREZ datasets can be found in the [Energy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/energy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains point locations for potential wind energy development projects. This dataset contains locations and site names only and does not include further attributes on wind energy output or other details.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains point locations representing areas that the UREZ Task Force determined to be viable for canyon wind energy development. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What does the dataset represent?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### How was the dataset created?

Each point in this dataset indicates a location, usually at the mouth of a canyon, that may have a higher-than-average wind output and thus may be suitable for wind energy development.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate locations for canyon wind energy development as determined by a 2008 study. These areas may not reflect current wind energy projects or regions where future projects are possible.
