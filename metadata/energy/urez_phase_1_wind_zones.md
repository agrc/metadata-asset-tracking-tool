# Title

Utah UREZ Phase 1 Wind Zones

## ID

8bb28df5-43cb-4568-a58d-d3d174db81d0

## Brief Summary

Potential areas for wind energy development as determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2008.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons that display areas for potential wind energy development. In addition to boundary data, this dataset include potential energy output from wind and estimated wind speeds in those regions.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains polygons representing areas that the UREZ Task Force determined to be viable for future wind energy development. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates an area with potential for wind energy development as determined by the UREZ Task Force' initial [Phase 1 inventory](https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/misc_pubs/MP-09-1.pdf). Features in this dataset include the site name, counties the site falls into, wind potential (mw_potent), estimated wind speed, elevation, and any location comments made by the UREZ Task Force.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the UREZ Task Force as part of their Phase 1 assessment of Utah lands.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate areas for wind energy development as determined by a 2008 study. These areas may not reflect current wind energy projects or regions where future projects are possible.
