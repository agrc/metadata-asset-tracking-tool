## Brief Summary

Polyline dataset of electrical lines in Utah as determined by the UREZ Task Force in 2008.

## Summary

This dataset represents electrical transmission lines in Utah as digital polylines. These transmission lines were assessed as part of the Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force during an initial inventory in 2008.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This dataset contains polylines representing electrical transmission lines that existed as of 2008. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force and their goals on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general analytic and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polyline in this dataset indicates the approximate path of an electrical transmission line as studied by the UREZ Task Force' initial [Phase 1 inventory](https://ugspub.nr.utah.gov/publications/misc_pubs/MP-09-1.pdf). Features in this dataset include the average voltage (KV) and any UREZ comments.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by the UREZ Task Force as part of their Phase 1 assessment of Utah energy resources.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate electrical transmission paths as determined by a 2008 study. These areas may not reflect current electricity projects or regions where future projects are possible.
