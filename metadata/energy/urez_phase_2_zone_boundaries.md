# Title

Utah UREZ Phase 2 Zone Boundaries

## ID

b68b9769-37cb-4cd7-8089-cb23904d323d

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of conceptual boundaries for renewable energy resource modelling.

## Summary

This dataset contains polygons representing conceptual boundaries created to quantify the resources available within an area for modeling purposes. They do not indicate actual planned transmission service to these areas or the location of planned transmission interconnection points, and renewable development is not precluded in other areas that do not fall inside zone boundaries.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

The Utah Renewable Energy Zone (UREZ) Task Force was commissioned in 2008 by Governor Jon Huntsman to assess Utah's renewable energy resources such as geothermal, wind, and solar. This layer contains conceptual zones developed for Phase 2 of the UREZ project. You can learn more about the UREZ Task Force and their goals on the [Utah Geological Survey website](https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/energy-news/energy-news-utahs-renewable-energy-zone-assessment/).

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

These Phase 2 zone boundaries were developed to quantify renewable energy resources in Utah for a screening level and further resource analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates a zone with potential for wind, solar, geothermal, or other renewable energy development. These boundaries are not intended to suggest that renewable resources inside a zone should be developed first, or that those areas outside of a zone either should not or cannot be developed.

### How was the dataset created?

This dataset was created by consultants contracted by the UREZ Task Force as part of their [Phase 2 assessment](https://geology.utah.gov/docs/emp/UREZphase2.pdf) of Utah energy resources.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset reflects approximate areas of potential renewable energy development as of September 2010. These areas may not reflect current renewable energy projects or regions where future projects are possible.
