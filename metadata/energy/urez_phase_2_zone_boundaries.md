## Brief Summary

## Summary

## Description

Zones represent conceptual boundaries created to quantify the resources available within an area for modeling purposes. They do not indicate actual planned transmission service to these areas or the location of planned transmission interconnection points, and renewable development is not precluded in other areas that do not fall inside zone boundaries.

This layer contains the Phase II zones created for Phase II of the Utah Renewable Energy Zones project. Phase II zone boundaries were developed to quantify renewable energy resources in Utah for a screening level renewable energy resource analysis. These boundaries are not intended to suggest that renewable resources inside a zone should be developed first, or that those areas outside of a zone either should not or cannot be developed.
