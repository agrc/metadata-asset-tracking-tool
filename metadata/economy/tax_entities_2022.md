## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of public entities responsible for collecting taxes to fund local services and infrastructure.

## Summary

Polygon dataset of tax entities in Utah as of 2022. This dataset includes general administrative boundaries for tax entities only and does not include information about current tax laws, rates, or deadlines.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset includes all incorporated bodies that have the power to levy a local property tax. These entities include school districts, counties, cities, special service districts, and redevelopment districts.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

These data were created for display and analysis of Utah tax entities for the 2022 calendar year.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the geographical coverage of a given tax entity. Features in this dataset include a brief description of the entity, entity code, and when the feature was added as a tax entity.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset through a collaborative effort with the [Governor's Office of Planning and Budget](https://gopb.utah.gov/), the [Utah Department of Transportation](https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/), and the [Utah State Tax Commission](https://tax.utah.gov/). We developed this dataset using coordinate geometry from legal descriptions. The dataset initially represented all incorporated tax entities in the state from 1984 to 1992. Today, this dataset includes all annexations and de-annexations as of the 2022 calendar year.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset represents an administrative baseline only and does not include exact legal boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
