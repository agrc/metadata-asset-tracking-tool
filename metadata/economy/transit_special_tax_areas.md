## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of areas where additional sales tax is collected to support public transportation.

## Summary

This dataset contains administrative boundaries for transit special tax areas in Utah. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not contain current tax rates or other legal information. Further tax-related boundary data can be found in the [Economy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/economy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygons representing areas where an additional sales tax is collected to support transit activities, usually public busses. In Utah, these special tax areas can be found in Cache, Summit, Tooele, and Utah counties.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset represents the approximate jurisdiction of a special tax area. Features in this dataset include the county include the county identifier, tax district number, and name of the special tax area.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset in collaboration with the Office of the [Utah State Auditor](https://auditor.utah.gov/) and the [Utah State Tax Commission](https://tax.utah.gov/). This effort combined coordinate geometry from legal descriptions and historical records to develop this dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, rather, it contains a set of polygon boundaries used for general geospatial purposes that conform to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent). Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
