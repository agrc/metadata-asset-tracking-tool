Utah Entities Non Tax

## ID

58480c2c-fec5-489b-b00b-9537ab9f28df

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of Utah State entities that do not collect taxes but may collect fees.

## Summary

This dataset contains administrative boundaries for non-taxing government entities in Utah. This dataset contains boundary information only and does not contain current tax rates or other legal information. Further tax-related boundary data can be found in the [Economy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/economy/) available from the SGID.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset contains polygon boundaries for government entities that do not levy taxes but may collect fees. These include local and special service districts which are funded through fees, mineral lease monies or other non-tax funding alternatives. This dataset also includes redevelopment agencies that collect incremental tax funds from government taxing entities.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference, as a cartographic resource, and for economic analysis.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon in this dataset indicates the jursidiction of a non-tax entity. Features in this dataset include a brief description of the entity (ent_desc), the county entity is located in (ent_co) and the year it was added to this dataset (ent_yr).

<!--- These are some guesstimates on what the fields indicate. All of the features have 2014 as the ent_yr, do we know what that number refers to and if it should be the same for all the features? --->

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset in collaboration with the Office of the [Utah State Auditor](https://auditor.utah.gov/) and the [Utah State Tax Commission](https://tax.utah.gov/). This effort combined coordinate geometry from legal descriptions and historical records to develop this dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, rather, it contains a set of polygon boundaries used for general geospatial purposes that conform to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent). Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.

<!--- The original metadata said this was current as of 2016. Has it since been updated? --->
