## Summary

## Description

This data set represents the approximate boundaries of Sales Tax Areas for the State of Utah. Individual Sales Tax Area polygons are formed by each municipality, special sales tax district (in 2006, there were 6 special transit districts) and the unincorporated areas of each county not in a special sales tax district. This dataset also contains an attribute that can be used to dissolve the Sales Tax polygons into the polygons representing tax areas for the proposed Streamlined Sales Tax implementation.
