## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of sales tax zones and special tax districts in Utah.

## Summary

Sales Tax Areas are formed by municipality boundaries, special sales tax districts and the unincorporated areas of counties not in a special sales tax district. This dataset represents these areas as polygons and is updated quarterly to reflect the most recent tax rates.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

This dataset represents the approximate boundaries of Sales Tax Areas for the State of Utah. Individual Sales Tax Area polygons are formed by each municipality, special sales tax district (in 2006, there were 6 special transit districts) and the unincorporated areas of each county not in a special sales tax district.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

This dataset has been made available to the public for general reference and cartographic purposes. Further tax-related boundary data can be found in the [Economy Data Index](https://gis.utah.gov/products/sgid/economy/) available from the SGID.

<!--- I noticed there are several tax look-up websites that might use our data. Do we know for sure if this dataset feeds any particular apps or websites? --->

### What does the dataset represent?

Polygons in this dataset represent the jurisdiction of a given tax zone. Features in this dataset include the tax district number, [FIPS code](https://www.nist.gov/standardsgov/compliance-faqs-federal-information-processing-standards-fips), name, whether the area is a special tax district (special), current sales tax rate (currate), date the rate was updated (ratedate), and county. This dataset also contains an attribute that can be used to dissolve the Sales Tax polygons into the polygons representing tax areas for the proposed [Streamlined Sales Tax](https://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/) implementation.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset in collaboration with the Office of the [Utah State Auditor](https://auditor.utah.gov/) and the [Utah State Tax Commission](https://tax.utah.gov/). This effort combined coordinate geometry from legal descriptions and historical records to develop this dataset.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, rather, it contains a set of polygon boundaries used for general geospatial purposes that conform to logical and administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent). Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/about/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
