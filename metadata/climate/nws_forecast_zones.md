## Brief Summary

## Summary

These data represent the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Zone boundaries within the state of Utah.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

These data represent the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Zone boundaries within the state of Utah. The NWS issues forecasts and some watches and warnings for these zones, which often align with county boundaries, but in many cases are subsets of counties. Counties are broken or combined into zones to allow for more accurate forecasts because of the differences in weather within a county due to such things as elevation or proximity to large bodies of water.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset from a [nationwide](https://www.weather.gov/gis/PublicZones) dataset provided by the National Weather Service. We projected the data into UTM Zone 12N ([EPSG: 26912](https://epsg.io/26912)) and clipped the forecast zones to the Utah state boundary. These zones are updated as new information becomes available from the NWS.

<!--- The original metadata specified the EPSG code for the coordinate system, which is something I haven't seen repeated often in our other datasets. Is that an essential detail to include for this dataset in particular? --->
