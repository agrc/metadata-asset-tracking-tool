## Brief Summary

## Summary

These data represent the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Zone boundaries within the state of Utah.

Last Update: 3/31/2021

These data represent the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Zone boundaries within the state of Utah. The NWS issues forecasts and some watches and warnings for these zones, which often align with county boundaries, but in many cases are subsets of counties. Counties are broken or combined into zones to allow for more accurate forecasts because of the differences in weather within a county due to such things as elevation or proximity to large bodies of water.

The data were adapted from a national shapefile provided by the NWS at: https://www.weather.gov/gis/PublicZones. They were then projected into UTM Zone 12N (EPSG: 26912), clipped, and snapped to the Utah state boundary.
