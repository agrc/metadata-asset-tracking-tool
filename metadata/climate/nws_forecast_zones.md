Utah NWS Forecast Zones

## ID

92b56cc3-e822-4d6f-ae3f-1c750498a5bf

## Brief Summary

Polygon dataset of zones used to estimate weather conditions for various regions throughout Utah.

## Summary

This dataset includes polygon boundaries for the National Weather Service (NWS) Forecast Zones found within Utah. This dataset includes forecast zones only and does not include other climate information such as surface temperature or precipitation.

## Description

### What is the dataset?

These data represent the [National Weather Service](https://www.weather.gov/) (NWS) Forecast Zone boundaries within the state of Utah. The NWS issues forecasts and some watches and warnings for these zones, which often align with county boundaries, but in many cases are subsets of counties. Counties are broken or combined into zones to account for differences in weather trends due to topographic factors.

### What is the purpose of the dataset?

NWS uses these zones to issue weather forecasts for areas in Utah. You can find examples of these forecasts from the NWS Salt Lake City Office on their [Zone Forecast Product](https://www.weather.gov/wrh/TextProduct?product=zfpslc) page.

### What does the dataset represent?

Each polygon feature in this dataset represents the approximate geographic boundaries of a NWS zone. Features in this dataset include attributes such as the time_zone, name, coordinates, as well as several NWS codes.

### How was the dataset created?

UGRC created this dataset from a [nationwide](https://www.weather.gov/gis/PublicZones) dataset provided by the National Weather Service. We projected the data into UTM Zone 12N and clipped the forecast zones to the Utah state boundary. These zones are updated as new information becomes available from the NWS.

### How reliable and accurate is the dataset?

This dataset is consistent with current NWS Forecast Zone boundaries. Please reach out to [our team](https://gis.utah.gov/contact/) with questions or concerns about this dataset.
